Watching the version without subtitles was a bit challenging, but you could feel that they were serious about bringing this poet's story to the audience. The plain cinematography, these mountains and rivers, and the bustling streets evoke longing and reflection. There's a small detail where some people glance sideways at the camera. There was also a simple translated line that was quite moving, "if my life is so bitter, then how much worse is the life of the general populace?"
