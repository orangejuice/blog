Watching a version without subtitles was a bit tough, but you could feel the earnest desire to share this poet's story with the audience. The straightforward camera narrative on nature and marketplace is profoundly affecting, stirring longing and reflection. There's a small detail where people on camera would glance sideways. There's also a very simple translated line that is very moving, "if my life is so bitter, then how much worse is the life of the common people?"
