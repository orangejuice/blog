  subtitle: Will Durant Ariel Durant / 2010 / Simon & Schuster
  intro: >-
    The Lessons of History is a book by historians Will Durant and Ariel Durant.

    In The Lessons of History the authors provided a summary of periods and
    trends in history they had noted upon completion of their momentous eleven
    volume The Story of Civilization. Will Durant stated that he and Ariel "made
    note of events and comments that might illuminate present affairs, future
    probabilities, the nature of man, and the conduct of states."

    The book thus presents an overview of the themes and lessons observed from
    5000 years of world history examined from 13 perspectives such as geography,
    biology, race, character, morals, religion, economics, socialism,
    government, war, growth and decay and progress.
