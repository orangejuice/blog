The narrative pace is leisurely and long, just like life. However, it carefully selects certain shots and removes content unrelated to the theme. The young faces in this movie are so beautiful, well done director. I know you want to make people yearn for youth. Seeing the mockery of lamas not being able to fly, I knew he was going to fly soon after. Thereâ€™s nothing particularly outstanding, just a decent storybook.
