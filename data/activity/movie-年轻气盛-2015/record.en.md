The calm and long narrative rhythm is just like life. What's different is that some shots have been carefully selected, and content irrelevant to the theme has been removed. The youthful faces in this film are so beautiful, well done, director. I know you want people to lust for youth. I knew he was going to fly when I saw the mocking that the lama couldnâ€™t fly. There's nothing particularly outstanding, it's just a pretty good storybook.
