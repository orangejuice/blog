Watching 'Reply 1988' made me cry so hard via Twitter Mia. My adolescence was long, and so was my rebellious phase. For a very long time, I always felt that my parents were very close and 'excluding' me. During those years, I seldom spoke at home because speaking often led to heated arguments. Looking back over the past few years, I just feel so foolish. I always think I missed out on a lot of love. I didn't start loving them early enough, nor properly.
