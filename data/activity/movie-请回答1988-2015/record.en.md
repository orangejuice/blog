After watching 'Reply 1988', Mia from Taiwan was moved to tears. My adolescence was long, as was my period of rebellion. For a very long, long time, I always felt that my parents were so in love with each other, it felt like they were 'excluding' me. For a few years, I barely spoke at home because it often led to arguments. Looking back now, I just feel that I was so naive. I feel like I missed out on a lot of love back then because I didn't love them early and deeply enough.
