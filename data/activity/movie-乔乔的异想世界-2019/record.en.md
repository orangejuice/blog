A wonderful child’s perspective, how can this kid act so brilliantly? A successful comedy that maintains realism. Admirable mother and officer handling danger with humor and wit, making it a hopeful and great film. The ending does not shy away from humanity—the scene where he lies about Germany winning, fearing she would leave, was too realistic.
