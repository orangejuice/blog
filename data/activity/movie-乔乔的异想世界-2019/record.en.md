An amazing perspective from a child, such a superb acting from this kid. A successful comedy that does not lose touch with reality. Admirable mother and officer coping with danger through humor and wit, a film filled with hope. The ending does not shy away from the human natureâ€”the scene where he lied to Elsa that Germany won, fearing her departure, is too real.
