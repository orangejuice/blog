I have finally experienced this wonderful dream of the Red Mansion, which is ineffable. How admirable is the old Cao from hundreds of years ago! The abundance of his emotions, literature, talent, knowledge, insight, thought, and his astounding foresight, with a few words, he is able to express countless details. It genuinely makes me feel like I have lived my twenty-odd years in vain. How can I continue to live like a corpse, sunken in modern life? Whenever I have a bit of thought, I feel as if I have become refreshingly unconventional, but even with my wisdom, I am not equal to a maid.
