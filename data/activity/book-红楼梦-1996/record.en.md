Having finally experienced the dreamlike beauty of Dream of the Red Chamber, it's indescribably wonderful. How did the old Cao from over a century ago manage to so impress? His rich emotions, writing skill, talent, knowledge, insight, thinking, and forward-thinking perspective are conveyed in just a few words yet express so much. It really makes me feel like I've lived these twenty-some years in vain. How shall I face living like a dead soul lost in modern life? Merely harboring thoughts makes me feel refreshed and detached from worldly concerns, realizing that my intelligence and nature pale in comparison to even a maid's.
