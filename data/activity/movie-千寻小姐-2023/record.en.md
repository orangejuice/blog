Via Twitter @OsakaOtaku This year's best and most realistic Japanese movie.

A sex worker arrives at a small town's bento shop to work, with a decent amount of cash in her pocket, earning a salary from Weibo and renting a small room, leading a very free life. She doesn't hide her past job; dealing with such matters as naturally as drinking water—drink when thirsty, very casual. She also doesn't want to be someone's possession, living very freely. Even when her own parents passed away, the story actually revolves more around how she interacts with others, affects them, and together confronts loneliness. A boy raised by a single mother who cannot appreciate his chef mother's gourmet meals, a girl who runs a bento shop with her husband—each character leaves a deep impression. There's also her attitude towards different deaths, views on love and sex... A very good script and production, a detailed Japanese movie filled with nuances.
