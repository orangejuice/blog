Via tw Otaku Osaka, the best and most realistic Japanese movie of the year. A hostess comes to work in a small town bento shop with ample cash in her pocket. She picks up her modest paycheck from Weibo, rents a small room, and lives a very free life. She does not conceal her past jobs. She handles certain matters as casually as drinking water - when you're thirsty, you should drink. She doesn't want to be someone's belonging, leading a very free life, even when her own parents pass away. This story is actually more about how she interacts with other people, influences them, and fights loneliness together. A single mother's young boy, a girl who can't taste the delicate dishes made by her chef mother, the husband and wife owners of the bento shop, each character leaves a deep impression. Also, her attitudes towards different kinds of death, views on love and sex... The script and filming are excellent. A very Japanese movie full of details.
