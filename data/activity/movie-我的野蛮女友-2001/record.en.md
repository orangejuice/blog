The actors are quite intriguing, but the plot is boring. It pairs well with popcorn; watching it while eating alone feels like a sheer waste of time. The most memorable scene was during a performance in a large auditorium, where the silent, diverse audience intensely conveyed a sense of reality. In contrast to this glamorous prosperity, perhaps simplicity is the true essence.
