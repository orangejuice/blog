      comment: A beautiful fairy tale for children. It casts the unbounded imagination
        of children, always meeting their perpetual curiosity, journeying on the
        adventure, wanting to explore unknown fields, respected and pampered by
        adults, and occasionally wanting to be heroes. Life should never be
        bland; life is constantly presenting challenging yet manageable tasks.
        Being the center of the world carries the innate superpower and an
        inescapable noble mission, always prepared to sacrifice everything for
        oneself, facing crises with nobility, never sparing oneself, not
        doubting oneself, patiently staying by one's side, having a partner who
        is attractive, fun, and uniquely talented, always facing an equally
        formidable opponent who somehow always ends up defeated. A lifetime as
        dazzling as fireworks.

      comment: A beautiful fairy tale for children. It constantly casts the wide
        imagination of kids, continually satisfies their constant curiosity and
        adventurous journey to explore unknown territories, wishing for adult's
        acknowledgment, respect, and love, occasionally playing the hero. Life
        should never be uninteresting; life always presents challenging yet
        manageable tasks. Born as the center of the world, bearing innate
        superpowers and an unavoidable grand mission, always prepared to give
        one's all, facing crisis valiantly, never questioning or oppressing
        oneself, absolutely loyal and always standing by one's side, and having
        a beautiful, kind-hearted, capable partner, facing an opponent who is
        equal in power yet always inevitably loses to oneself—a spectacular
        spiritual world like fireworks.

It projects the limitless imagination of children, satisfying their eternal curiosity, their constant quest for adventure, their desire to explore unknown realms, their hope for recognition and affection from adults, and their occasional wish to be heroes. Life should never be mundane; life always presents challenging yet manageable tasks. Born as the center of the world, endowed with innate supernatural abilities and an inescapable grand mission, always ready to give one's all, face crises with integrity, never question oneself, and have a beautiful, kind, competent soulmate who is equal yet invariably ends up losing to oneself—a spectacular world of spirit like fireworks.
