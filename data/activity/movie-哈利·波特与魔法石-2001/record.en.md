      comment: A fairy tale dedicated to children, where the child’s wild imagination
        is everywhere to be seen. Satisfying a perpetually curious mind, always
        adventurous, exploring the unknown, cherished and respected by adults,
        and hoping to play the hero at times. Life should never be mundane,
        there’s always a challenging matter within one’s own ability that needs
        handling. Living as the center of the world, endowed with inborn
        superpowers and a great duty that can't be brushed off. Ready at all
        times to give one’s all, facing crises with moral courage without
        sparing oneself or questioning one’s abilities. Patient, always stays by
        one’s side. A boyfriend or girlfriend who is attractive, interesting,
        and has unique abilities. An equally challenging but always losing
        adversary who exudes dominance. A person’s life's spiritual world that
        shines brightly like fireworks.

A beautiful fairy tale dedicated to children. Everywhere reflects the boundless spirit of the child, satisfying the always curious, always on the way to adventure, wanting to explore unknown areas, hope to get adult approval, respect and love, and occasionally dream of being a hero. Life should never be flat, there is always a challenging task within one's capacity to deal with at all times. Born in the centre of the world, with innate superpowers and an unshirkable great mission, always prepared to offer everything for oneself, be spartan in the face of crisis, never doubt or belittle oneself, lovingly stay by one's side just like before, have a beautiful, kind-hearted and capable partner, and always lose to an adversary who is an equal match but always can't help being defeated. A spiritual world as brilliant as fireworks.
