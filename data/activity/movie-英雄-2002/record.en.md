A host of renowned actors bring a majestic and powerful presence, with striking colors and outstanding music. The scenes are exquisitely crafted; the control is so strong, deeply admirable, a highlight moment for Director Zhang. It explores the themes of national resilience, repression, and the pursuit of righteousness with ample close-ups; the confrontations and choices between the broken sword, the Nameless swordsman, and the King of Qin evoke a profound melancholy. It's a pity that Chinese cinema hasn't continued to evolve from there. Otherwise, 20 years on, how many more excellent films, new directors, and fresh perspectives might there have been? Where are they now?
