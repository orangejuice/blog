A host of famous roles, awe-inspiring and dominating the world, with vibrant colors, outstanding music, and exquisite scenes, demonstrate great control. I deeply admire this, Zhang's directorial highlight. The hidden patience, repression, and quest of this nation are given full focus; the confrontation and choices between the broken sword, the Nameless Swordsman, and the King of Qin, deeply touch one's heart. I sigh that the Chinese film industry didn't continue to develop. Otherwise, 20 years have passed, how many good films, how many new directors, how many new perspectives would we have seen? Where are they now?
