Exquisite acting, wildly eccentric, filled with a unique aesthetic style. The film offers a glimpse into the affluence of America in the 1970s, as well as the realities of crime and social psychology in an era before advanced forensic technology. The antisocial young man, despite committing detestable and outrageous crimes, is portrayed with a unique charm and innocence. As a case study dissected and analyzed, it teaches us a lesson on what freedom and social responsibility mean. Upon revisiting, I find that the film leaves behind many classic scenes, especially the ending duel between Alex and the minister. I don't care at all about the dialogue between the two; it's Alex's brilliant performance that captures all my attention. The unreserved exhibition of sexual violence is indeed quite avant-garde and bold.
