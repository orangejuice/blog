Much of it still reads like casual spoken dialogue on paper, with plenty of repetition and superfluous language. The content is not concise enough, and the depth varies inconsistently throughout: some parts are detailed while others that require explanation are glossed over. Nonetheless, it is very worthwhile for beginners. The organization of knowledge is valuable, and the summaries of viewpoints are enlightening, helping to refine vague impressions. One can find a bit of solace in the author's perspective.
