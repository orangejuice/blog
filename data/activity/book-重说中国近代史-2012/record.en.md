There are many places where colloquial expressions are used even when written on paper, causing repetitions or redundancies. The content is not concise enough, with inconsistent depths and breadths. Some areas are explained in great detail, while others that need explanations are glossed over. Nonetheless, it is very worthwhile for beginners to read this, as many knowledge tidbits are valuable and the overall viewpoints are inspiring, helping to refine vague impressions. Readers can find solace from the author's standpoint.
