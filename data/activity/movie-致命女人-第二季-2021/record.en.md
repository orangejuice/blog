The scent of power and status, mixed with ambition as a teaser, is like an aphrodisiac, like a drug, luring one deeper and deeper, unable to extricate oneself. This show does not insult women, but rather, sings a sad song for them. They do not all wish to stay hidden away, admiring themselves in solitude; they too have discontentments and aspirations. The series has its moments of poor plot development, especially flagrant in the third episode. It almost made me quit, but out of curiosity (or boredom), I continued watching. Even though some parts of the logical chain are poorly tied by the scriptwriters, the essence of the series still remains, with its characters, performances, props, psychology, and suspense.
