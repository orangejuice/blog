The aroma of power and status, coupled with ambition as a primer, is like an aphrodisiac, like a drug, which makes people unable to extricate themselves from it. This show does not insult women, but in fact it is a composition of the pity of women. They don't all want to hide themselves in the boudoir, admiring themselves alone, they also have dissatisfaction, and have something to look up to. There is a lot of plot development in the middle of the show that is a mess, and it's particularly bad in the third episode. I considered giving up on the show before even finishing it, but out of curiosity (or boredom), I kept watching. Even though certain parts of the logical chain of the plot aren't well-crafted by the scriptwriter, the show still has its flavor, its characters, performances, props, psychology, and suspense.
