The fearless and noble white male protagonist is truly magnificent, humorous, and kind-hearted, seemingly born for the silver screen. Leonardo's manic performance is highly stylized, reminiscent of watching 'The Wolf of Wall Street' on drugs. It's a historical romance filled with beauty and positivity.
