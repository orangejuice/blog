The narrative level is so strong, coupled with the very good performances of the children, filled with a sense of youth. It is a youth marked by poverty that is unique to the Middle Eastern Islamic culture, different from the West and the East. The film transcends religion and the secular, becoming a modern work that can be universally accepted by different cultures and backgrounds. Unlike the usual perceptions of Iran, the Middle East, and Islam, this film stands on an advanced cultural and cognitive level. The people on the screen are no different from ordinary people, with moral and intellectual frameworks based on a modern secular society with Middle Eastern characteristics. The details are rich and the techniques are clever, presenting without criticizing, a rarity.

His youth is about running, taking care of the family, protecting his sister, striving to become stronger, excelling in everything.
Her youth is about running, taking care of the family, being considerate of her brother, and being a sensitive girl who is competitive and sensible.
