    New York Times Book Review 10 Best Books of 2018 A New York Times Notable
    Book The #1 New York Times bestseller. A brilliant and brave investigation
    into the medical and scientific revolution taking place around psychedelic
    drugs--and the spellbinding story of his own life-changing psychedelic
    experiences When Michael Pollan set out to research how LSD and psilocybin
    (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are being used to provide relief
    to people suffering from difficult-to-treat conditions such as depression,
    addiction and anxiety, he did not intend to write what is undoubtedly his
    most personal book. But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are
    improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people
    coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore
    the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus
    began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness,
    along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving
    underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical
    record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths
    that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic
    evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was
    then a promising field of research. A unique and elegant blend of science,
    memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a
    triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is
    the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier
    in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The
    true subject of Pollan's "mental travelogue" is not just psychedelic drugs
    but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that
    offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and
    find meaning in our lives.
