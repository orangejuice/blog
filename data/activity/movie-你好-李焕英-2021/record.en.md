It's a refreshingly unique tribute to the mother in the form of a memorial film. The work is impressively beyond expectation, featuring lighter performance, focusing on family and mother-child relationship. It's filled with tenderness and sentiment. In my view, this work is quite remarkable, with performances from the northeastern troupe being far from mundane and aiming to revive the dormant sense of filial piety in the hearts of the audience, giving it youthful vitality in modern society. (The screen time of Leng Te made me fully realize Jia Ling's confidence, the cultivation of the mother on this point couldn't be more laudable)
