A refreshingly dedicated tribute to mothers. Unexpectedly brilliant, it offers a lighter depiction, focusing on family and mother-son relationships, filled with tenderness and emotion. In my view, this is a phenomenal work with a distinctly unconventional performance by the Northeastern style, which attempts to awaken the dormant filial piety in the audience's hearts, rejuvenating it with youthful vigor in modern society. (I devoted all my attention to Jia Ling's confidence thanks to the scenes with Leng Te, and the way this mother nurtured that aspect is beyond commendable.)
