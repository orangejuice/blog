As stated by Guangbai Songzhai via Twitter, to prove the existence of reincarnation, one must first understand that 'everything is emptiness' is a fact; we fundamentally live in a 'virtual' world. To grasp this, one must thoroughly study the double-slit experiment with electrons. Lectures by Professor Gao Yongquan from Taiwan University and Professor Brian Cox’s 'The Quantum Universe' are very beneficial. But most importantly, one should study 'The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way', and I recommend Sodargye Rinpoche's 'Lectures on the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'.
