      comment: The electronic version I read had poor formatting, but that didn’t
        obstruct the rich content. The short length of the piece limited
        detailed character stories, yet the clues revealed are enough to evoke
        feelings of emotion and helplessness. Whatever's shown is only the tip
        of the iceberg, but it still has shape, being quite three-dimensional.
        The final turn in the narrative toward Buddhism makes the implications
        even more profound. The author’s sincerity and self-reflection is indeed
        not false, but they must have also been ruthless, cunning, and superior,
        playing the game of life amidst reality and fiction. An undercurrent of
        oppressive, decisive force that stays hidden offstage is perceptibly
        present, albeit subtly. The 'masses' are like ceaseless, hard-working
        ants, out of which emerge big players, looking no different from other
        ants. Either already equipped or gradually acquiring the mastery, they
        have the audacity and means to manipulate and dictate groups of people
        under the push of fate, networking with each other, reaping benefits,
        and monopolizing power. Standing high and looking afar, viewing the
        bustle in the dust at the foothill, it feels like seeing actual slaves
        and subjects creating profits for themselves.

The electronic version I read had poor formatting, but that didn’t obstruct the rich content. The short length of the piece limited detailed character stories, yet the clues revealed frequently incite emotions and reflections. Only a corner is shown to the world, but it is to a certain extent shaped and dimensional. The final turn to Buddhism makes the implications even more profound. The author’s sincerity and self-reflection is indeed genuine, but they must have also been ruthless, cunning, and superior, playing the game of life with a mix of truth and deception. An undercurrent of oppressive, decisive power that doesn't make itself apparent on the surface is subtly perceived. The 'masses' are like ceaseless, hard-working ants, ever emerging big players who seem to be no different from other ants. With inherent or accumulated capacities, they gain the audacity and means to manipulate and dictate groups of people, networking with each other, reaping benefits, and monopolizing power under the push of fate. Standing high and looking afar, among the dust raised at the foothill, it seems that there are actual slaves and subjects creating profits for their masters. ‘If there really are ghosts, it’s probably uncomfortable to be one. Because it doesn't seem like you have to give anything to be a ghost, so what good treatment can there be?’
