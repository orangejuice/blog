The ending's words and actions shouldn't all be so poignant, as if all this lengthy buildup was just for that brief expression at the end. A very lovely and complete movie, yet it speaks of the sadness, helplessness, compromise, and flaws of life. Is it just this melancholic and helpless? So powerless.
