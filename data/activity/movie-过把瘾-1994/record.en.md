Via tw Tokyo Wenge - In recent years, this is the best domestic TV drama I have seen ðŸ“º "Just for Fun" (1994). I randomly started watching it for 10 minutes and ended up spending the whole night to finish it. Since then, it has become the No. 1 domestic drama in my heart, similar to the status of "Tokyo Love Story" in Japanese dramas.

Back then, this drama and its theme song ("Confused Love") became incredibly popular across the country. But at that time, I couldn't understand it. Watching it now, it feels incredibly realistic.

It evokes a nostalgic feel of childhood while also offering a sharp and timeless discussion. It shows that in many aspects other than technical, Chinese TV dramas have been regressing.

Shan Jiang and Zhiwen Wang shine so brightly that even today, no one has surpassed their performances back then.

In today's romantic dramas, you'll probably never see a scene where a woman holds a knife to a man's neck and asks:

"Do you really love me or not!?"
