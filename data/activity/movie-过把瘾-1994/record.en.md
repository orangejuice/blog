Via Tokyo Wenge, in recent years, the best domestic #TV drama I've watched ðŸ“º"Addiction" (1994). I unintentionally opened it and watched 10 minutes, and then spent an entire night watching until the end of the drama. Since then, it has become No. 1 in my heart for Chinese TV dramas. Just like the status of "Tokyo Love Story" in Japanese dramas.

The TV show and its theme song ("Blurry Love") were popular all over the country. But at that time I didn't understand it. Now when I look back, it's scarily real.

It has a nostalgic sense of childhood life and sharp discussions that have not been outdated. It makes you feel that in addition to technology, other aspects of Chinese dramas are regressing.

Shan Jiang and Zhiwen Wang are so brilliant, and to this day, they havenâ€™t surpassed their performance in this film.

In today's love stories, you probably won't see a man being asked by a woman holding a knife to his throat:

"Do you really love me!?"
