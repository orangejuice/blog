Via Twitter, Yun stopped to read 'Station for Two', 'Tricks of Fate', and 'Office Stories'. He hopes these classic stories of joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain, can bring courage and strength to people's hearts. Their screenwriter/director Ryazanov once said in the autobiographical film 'Andersen': 'You have paid for the sins committed in life, because though you have suffered, you have never become vicious. Your creation has spread kindness in people's hearts, and in return, people have given you love and respect.'
