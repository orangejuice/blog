Via Twitter, Tingyun watched 'A Station for Two,' 'The Whims of Fate,' and 'Office Stories.' Hoping these classic stories of the bitter and sweet, the sorrows and joys of life, can bring inspiration and strength to the heart. Their screenwriter/director, Lyangzanov, once had a line in the autobiographical movie 'Andersen': 'You have redeemed the sins committed on Earth, for though you have suffered greatly, you have never become vicious. Your creations have sown kindness in people's hearts, and in return, they have given you love and admiration.'
