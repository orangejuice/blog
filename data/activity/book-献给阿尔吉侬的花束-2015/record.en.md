I endured the agony caused by mental strain and finished this work just like being there. A dull, childish soul who wanted to be smart, loved by friends, and loved, became irritable, resentfull, and self-pitying in loneliness and resistance once he gained intelligence. He exhausted himself searching for himself, finding foolish answers to outdated questions! Indeed, life is sorrowful, with its ebb and flow, and isnâ€™t everyone as ignorant as Charlie at his arrival, leaving confusedly? Suddenly born, driven by adults to learn language and knowledge, becoming smart leads to joining adults, dissatisfaction, competition, and pain. He built a sandcastle only to guard and watch it blur and collapse before his eyes... Allow me to issue a mournful wail! Translation minus one point, fluency and literary quality do not quite blend with the story's brilliance and depth.
