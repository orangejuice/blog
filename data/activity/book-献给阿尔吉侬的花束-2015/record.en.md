Carrying the pain caused by mental suffering, I finished this work very empathetically. A dull and naive soul, desiring to become smart, to be liked by friends, to be loved, becomes irritable, resentful, self-pitying and resistant once gaining wisdom. He exhausts himself in search of who he is, seeking foolish answers to age-old questions. Life is indeed bitter, with its ups and downs. Doesn't everyone arrive like Charlie, ignorant, and leave in confusion? Abrupt birth, driven by adults to learn language and knowledge, once becoming smart, we start to join adults, start being dissatisfied, start struggling, start suffering, we build a sand castle, then watch it blur and collapse right in front of our eyes... Allow me to let out a mournful howl! Deduct one point for the translation, where the fluency, literariness, and the brilliance and depth of the story do not blend well.
