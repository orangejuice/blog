  title: The Worlds I See
  subtitle: "Fei-Fei Li / 2023 / Flatiron Books: A Moment of Lift Book"
  intro: >-
    The moving memoir of a scientist coming of age as an immigrant in America
    who finds her calling at the forefront of the AI revolution.

    Wired called Dr. Fei-Fei Li “one of a tiny group of scientists―a group
    perhaps small enough to fit around a kitchen table―who are responsible for
    AI’s recent remarkable advances.”

    Known to the world as the creator of ImageNet, a key catalyst of modern
    artificial intelligence, Dr. Li has spent more than two decades at the
    forefront of the field. But her career in science was improbable from the
    start. As immigrants, her family faced a difficult transition from China’s
    middle class to American poverty. And their lives were made all the harder
    as they struggled to care for her ailing mother, who was working tirelessly
    to help them all gain a foothold in their new land.

    Fei-Fei’s adolescent knack for physics endured, however, and positioned her
    to make a crucial contribution to the breakthrough we now call AI, placing
    her at the center of a global transformation. Over the last decades, her
    work has brought her face-to-face with the extraordinary possibilities―and
    the extraordinary dangers―of the technology she loves.

    The Worlds I See is a story of science in the first person, documenting one
    of the century’s defining moments from the inside. It provides a riveting
    story of a scientist at work and a thrillingly clear explanation of what
    artificial intelligence actually is―and how it came to be. Emotionally raw
    and intellectually uncompromising, this book is a testament not only to the
    passion required for even the most technical scholarship but also to the
    curiosity forever at its heart.
