The female lead is so adorable and sweet (star-eyed), the characters and plot strictly follow standard routines. Both individuals are very mature and not much of words, they are smooth in every move and gaze, without overstepping any boundaries, perfect personalities. But the depiction of conflicts is perhaps very realistic, where one side gradually shifts from romance to reality due to the pressure of society, while the other insists on pursuing romance. Novelty fades, distance grows, all the careful, awkward courtesies transform into habitual indifference and impatience. The details of love life are very captivating. At first, my viewing experience was: except for few lucky ones who do what they like and earn a decent income, most people might not be destined for such happiness and joy. To work or not, with or without pressure, to be philosophical or remain ignorant, isn't life like a trapped beast living in dissatisfaction? However, after watching the ending that follows the beginning, it's not that complicated and depressing, life is quietly pleasant with its light sunshine and the future is full of hope. The two still love each other and freely fly, each having seen a different world, meeting again, their hearts are moved again, whether together or not, it's always beautiful.
