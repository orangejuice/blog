The female lead is adorably sweet and idealized, with large, starry-eyed expressions. The characters and plot follow a standard formula, with both characters appearing excessively mature. They don't say much, their actions and glances never clingy, and never cross certain boundaries, embodying a perfect character. However, the conflicts portrayed are rather realistic; one person consciously picks up societal pressures and gradually shifts from romance to reality, while the other steadfastly pursues romance. The fresh excitement fades, distances grow, and the nervous, overly polite gestures turn into habits of ignoring and impatience. The details of their love life are captivating. My initial impression of the movie was that except for a few lucky ones who do what they love and earn a decent living, most people probably won't experience this kind of happiness and joy. Whether to work or not, whether there is pressure or none, whether to contemplate deeply or remain oblivious, life is full of discontent. But after watching till the end and reviewing the beginning, I realized it's not so complex or depressing. With a gentle sun and a quiet life, tomorrow is full of hope. With love in their hearts, they fly freely, taking a look at the world independently and upon reuniting, they feel the flutter of heartbeats once again. Regardless of whether they end up together, it is beautiful.
