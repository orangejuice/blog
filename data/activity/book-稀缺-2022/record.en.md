Via tw juransir: I used to be in an all-in work state, only to find that my work efficiency during holidays is almost zero. What could have been accomplished in one hour, can't be completed in an afternoon. Any problem encountered in the work is not solved, the only thing that gets resolved is the anxiety in my heart. 

However, the fact that I spent time but did not solve the problem, only makes me more anxious, and then continues to think about the deadline for this matter, how it should be done, and finally viciously circulate, becoming more anxious. 

Starting from this year, I have thoroughly learned to 'play well when you play, and work well when you work'. 

When relaxing, let go of the work, forget about my to-do items, forget about the imminent S-level project. I later discovered that overall efficiency has actually improved. Even after I spent a few days deeply relaxing, I came up with some new ideas and thoughts. 

Once again, I strongly recommend the book "Scarcity". We should never have a 'tunnel vision' at any time, and leave ourselves some 'leisure time'.
