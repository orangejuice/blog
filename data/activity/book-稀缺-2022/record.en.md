Via Twitter user juransir: I used to be all in work mode all the time, but later I found that my work efficiency during vacations was almost zero. What I could usually finish in an hour, I couldn't complete in an afternoon. No work-related problem was solved, only my inner anxiety was alleviated.

However, spending time without solving any problems only made me more anxious, and then I would continue thinking about the deadlines and how to approach the tasks, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing anxiety.

Starting this year, Iâ€™ve thoroughly learned to 'play well when it's time to play, work well when it's time to work'.

When relaxing, I put aside work, forget about pending tasks, and ignore the upcoming major projects about to launch. I found that overall efficiency has actually increased. Even by taking a few days off for deep relaxation, I came up with some new ideas and creativity.

I strongly recommend the book "Scarcity" once again, encouraging everyone to avoid tunnel vision and to give ourselves some breathing room.
