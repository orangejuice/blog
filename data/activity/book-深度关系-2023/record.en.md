Recommended by balconychy, take a look at Zhihong Wu's 'Deep Relationships'. Having read it, you will find that in Chinese-style relationships (spouses, filial relationships), there are various subtle and unknowingly PUA instances. Although Professor Wu has a bit of a tendency to see all relationships as abnormal due to his career as a psychologist, the descriptions in the book indeed reflect the current state of Chinese family relationships. Handle relationships well, starting from becoming an independent person, love yourself enough before loving others.
