Recommended by balconychy to check out Wu Zhihong's 'Deep Connections'. After reading it, you will realize that in Chinese-style dyadic relationships (spouses, personal relations), there exist various subtle and unconscious Pickup Artist tactics. Although Professor Wu sometimes sees every relationship as abnormal due to his occupational habits as a psychologist, the descriptions in the book truly reflect the current state of Chinese family relations. Managing relationships well starts with being an independent individual, loving oneself sufficiently before loving others.
