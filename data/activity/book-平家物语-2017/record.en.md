After completing Director Yamada's 'The Tale of the Heike' via tw mier, I really felt quite emotional. Those who desire always meet a bad end, only through practicing Buddhism and making vows can one find peace. Having watched many historical dramas performed by Chinese actors, the style of Japanese historical dramas feels very different. I plan to catch up on several Taiga dramas about the Genpei War.
