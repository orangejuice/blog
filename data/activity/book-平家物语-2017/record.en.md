I've finally finished director Yamada's 'The Tale of the Heike,' and it really is quite sentimental. All who desire will not die well, only those who pray to Buddha. Watching historical dramas interpreted by the Chinese and then watching those interpreted by the Japanese, you can see a big difference in style. I plan to catch up on some of the great series about the Genpei War.
