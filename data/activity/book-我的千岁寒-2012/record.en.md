via Twitter @Tingyun: “Each of us, in our lives, whether we fare well or not, one day, whether seated high in the halls of power or lying drunk in the streets, suddenly doubts oneself, doubts the prosperity before one's eyes. This doubt is the seed of enlightenment.” — Wang Shuo, 'My Thousand Years of Cold'
