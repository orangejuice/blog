via tw Stopping Clouds “Every one of us in life, whether we are doing well or not, but one day, whether in high authority or drunk on the streets, suddenly questions themselves, questioning the prosperity in front of them, this doubt is the seed of enlightenment.” ——Wang Shuo, "My Thousand-Year Cold"
