Eager to see this highly-praised film, I watched it immediately. The intention is good, offering encouragement to the soul, telling us that the meaning of life is in the connection with our bodies and nature. We should focus on ourselves and nature and not get lost in a mindset that disconnects us from the natural world. Some scenes deeply moved me with their portrayal of the soul, but honestly, the plot development is rather shallow and nonsensical. The contrived conflicts are clich√©d, preventing the emotions from resonating continuously. It leaves you with a loud message, "Keep going, you can do it, life is beautiful, Earth is beautiful," but it offers little comfort to those who truly need help, like '22'. So, I'm a bit disappointed personally. However, maybe some people will still feel empowered, especially in this particularly challenging year.
