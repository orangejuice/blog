I couldn't wait to watch this high-rated movie. The intent is good, encouraging the soul and telling us that the meaning of life lies in our connection with our bodies and nature. We need to maintain our focus on ourselves and on nature, and not to be lost in a certain way of thinking that disconnects us from nature. Some scenes portraying the soul touched me, but to be honest, the plot was rather superficial and absurd, with some conflict-making episodes being very clich√©. This made it difficult for the audience to maintain their empathy. The message screamed out to the viewers is 'Keep going, you can do it, life is beautiful, earth is beautiful', but it brings little solace to those who genuinely need help like '22'. Therefore, I am slightly disappointed. However, perhaps some people may still feel inspired, especially in this unique year.
