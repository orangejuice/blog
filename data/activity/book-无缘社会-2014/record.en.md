Via tw Bean Bean, losing connection with others is like a living lonely death. No one cares about you, and you can't play any role. In this case, is there a difference between being alive and dead? Does it not differ from having disappeared as a person? So, I think verifying whether we are connected to others is confirming our existence. -- 'Disconnected Society'
