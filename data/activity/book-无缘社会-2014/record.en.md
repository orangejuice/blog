Via Twitter user Dou Xiaodou, losing connection with others feels like a living solitary death. No one cares about you, nor can you play any role. In that case, whether alive or dead, isn't it all the same? Isn't this the same as having already disappeared? Therefore, I believe that verifying whether you have connections with others is the same as confirming your own existence.
— From “Society without Connections”
