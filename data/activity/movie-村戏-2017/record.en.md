Content wise: It presents a life of strife and hardship, carrying a deep melancholy thatâ€™s always on the verge of expressing. It constantly reminds viewers of the beggars from blurred childhood memories, whose experiences have, astonishingly, become history's eternal mysteries after 20 years. However, the poor visual quality and the technology overpowering the context were unbearable. The combination of black and white visuals with drone footage is extremely jarring. The coloring techniques seemed very crude, disrupting the narration, and causing a loss of immersion. Also, after such a long build-up, there wasn't any progressive mystery-revealing relation. The ending lacked weight and could easily disappoint viewers. It might have been better to reveal everything all at once; it was quite a strenuous watch. Production wise: The performance was genuinely impressive; even a layman could appreciate the effort put into it. The madman's demeanor left me in admiration of the terrific actor. These people truly brought to life a cross-section of a village.
