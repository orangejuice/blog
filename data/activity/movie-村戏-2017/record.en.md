Content-wise: These are tough times indeed, always on the verge of sadness, reminiscent of the blurry memories of mad beggars from one's childhood, their stories turning into an eternal historic mystery 20 years later. However, the poor quality of the picture, along with overly technical elements, make the combination of black-and-white footage and aerial shots extremely awkward. The coloring technique feels rough, often pulling the viewer out of the narrative and losing any sense of immersion. Moreover, dragging out the mystery without revealing it progressively results in an unsatisfying ending, leaving one disappointed. It might have been better to have just laid it all out upfront, as it was quite tiring to watch. Production-wise: This solid performance, even a layman can feel the effort put in, and the madman's grace is truly admirable, a great actor. This group of people has virtually brought to life the various aspects of a village.
