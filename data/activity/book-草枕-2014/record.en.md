Via tw mier, I think a good translation is one where you can't help but become curious about who the amazing translator might be, halfway through reading. So far, I've only had this strong impression twice, with Chen Dewen's translation of 'The Grass Pillow', and Fan Ye's translation of 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'
