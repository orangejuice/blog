Via tw mier I believe that a good translation is one where halfway through, you can't help but be curious to see which divine translator worked on it. I've only had this strong impression twice, once with Chen Dewen's translation of 'The Grass Pillow,' and once with Fan Ye's translation of 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'.
