Reading it joyfully (and sadly), the diary ends abruptly. All I can do is sob without words, looking at each item set up in Anne's home, looking at the records filled by later generations before and after the story. Looking at the beautiful thoughts revealed between the lines by this young author, full of ideals, awareness, and bravery, possessing a strong sense of self, I feel a belated sense of companionship and happiness, but also pain. I can't imagine having such a book or even such a friend in my childhood, I can't imagine at the age of 13 reading as many books as she did and clearly knowing my own passions. For me, for Anne, for this world, I need to move on from an utterly horrible mood, hoping to be able to cry happily for 10 minutes. I will seek out other versions to read. The quality of the translated version in Chinese is not satisfactory.
