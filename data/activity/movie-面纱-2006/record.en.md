The setting is intriguing, with excellent backdrops of China in the rare 1920s setting. The movie has a sense of the era as long as the Chinese actors don't speak; their acting was so poor that the editing seems embarrassed to give them a full shot. The film feels somewhat bland, with the first half lacking tension, showing characters wandering aimlessly without clear purpose. Later, it vaguely becomes apparent that the movie has a theme, and only at the final line do you realize it aims to illustrate growth. Having not read the original, I just discovered it ranks 122 on Douban, which seems like it's worth a read.
