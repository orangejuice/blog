The setting is very interesting, and the set design is excellent, presenting a rarely seen China in the 1920s. As long as the Chinese actors in the film don't speak, it feels quite authentic. But the acting quality is disappointing, so much so that it's embarrassing to even show them in close-up. The film is somewhat bland, with the first half of the story lacking tension, and with characters moving around aimlessly. Only towards the end does it become clear that there's a theme to the film - it's about personal growth. I haven't read the original work yet, just discovered it's ranked 122 on Douban, seems like I should give it a read.
