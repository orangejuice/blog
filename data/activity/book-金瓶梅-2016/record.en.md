This work is a grand collection that interprets the life of officials and merchants, human relationships, social indifference, sycophancy, loyalty, filial piety, righteousness, Buddhism, Taoism, love, sex, good, and evil. Set in Qinghe County during the era of Chinese dynasties, it describes the life in the streets from a god-like perspective, observing coldly and capturing details meticulously, truly avant-garde and rebellious. Interestingly, 'Dream of the Red Chamber' is so similar to this work that it stands as the greatest affirmation of it, unknowing how many passers-by in the long river of history it has enlightened and astonished or how it has changed their destinies. A brief experience of the god-like perspective, upon returning to consciousness, realizes one is merely a character in the play, should act as one, is still one, remains trapped as one, unable to escape.
