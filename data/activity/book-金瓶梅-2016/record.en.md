This is a masterpiece that interprets officialdom, the ways of the world, society's fickleness, sycophancy, loyalty, piety, righteousness, Buddhism, Taoism, love, sex, good and evil. It's set in the town of Qinghe County in Chinese society, portraying the life of ordinary people with a God's-eye view, scrutinizing all the details impartially. It's both avant-garde and rebellious. The similarities between it and 'The Dream of the Red Chamber' is the greatest endorsement of this work. One wonders how many passers-by have been enlightened or stunned by this throughout history, and how it has shaped their destinies. A brief experience of God's-eye view, a sudden realization - we are but characters in this play, destined to remain as such. The essence of being a character in a play is irrevocable.
