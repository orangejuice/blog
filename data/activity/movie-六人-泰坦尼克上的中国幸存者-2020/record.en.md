A touching story. What moved me was the weight and lightness of history, an attitude of humble reverence and self-criticism, the affectionate reference to the survivors as 'our', the difficult road to survival of the Chinese people and the unique, intense and merciless social turmoil they went through. The meticulous preservation of records allows the traces of the lives of the deceased to be pieced together in this world. But the irony is that up until now, it is just a little-known tale from the farthest corner of the world, with few people caring about it.
