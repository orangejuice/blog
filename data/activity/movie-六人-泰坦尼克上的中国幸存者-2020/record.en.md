A touching story. What moved me was the thickness and lightness of history, the attitude of humble awe and self-criticism, calling the survivors 'our', the hard survival journey of the Chinese and the unique, intense, and ruthless social turbulence they experienced, and the meticulous, careful preservation of archives that allows the traces of the deceased's past lives to be reassembled in this world. Ironically, it still remains just a small story tucked away in a corner of the world's east, hardly capturing anyone's attention.
