Almost deceived by the prevalent slang, yet it turned out to be a delightful surprise. I finally managed to finish it in a few days. The thoughtfulness is delicate, the prose fluid, often coming across passages that stir the emotions, compelling me to circle them with a pen, and I really enjoyed the philosophical depth contained within. It vividly records many day-to-day details and personal experiences, creating a visceral connection to the text, making me feel as if I'm approaching the author, or rather, the author is approaching you, truly a literate and artistic youth. Our sensitive nerves are so similar, and at many points, it feels like I should weep, but tears are long gone. It feels like this personality is almost a well-read individual, emboldened by literature to face the world, who is lonely and abandoned in growth, only accompanied by a computer, accustomed to living unobtrusively. Perhaps because of the same undertone, melancholic and suffering from the depths of the universe. A person: another person adds a split in the world of infinite possibilities, and collectively humans form a bizarre and colorful flower. This is what makes nature so strict, cold, merciless, rational yet wonderful. Because of this author, I have developed an interest in the city of Xiamen. I must visit it.
