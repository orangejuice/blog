Almost overlooked by the inundation of popular phrases, it turned out to be a surprising masterpiece. I finally finished reading it in a few days. With a delicate mind and fluent wording, it often leads to touching paragraphs that you can't help but underline, and I love the philosophical taste contained within. Many daily details, many records of personal experiences and experiences, are described with a sense of flesh and emotion, making you feel like you are getting closer to the author, or rather, the author is getting closer to you. What an artistically gifted young man who knows how to write and draw. Many sensitive nerves are so similar, when reading many places, I always feel like crying, but I have no tears left. I always feel that this person is almost me, who is nurtured by literature and art and has the confidence to face the world, and I am the one who grew up being lonely and cold, accompanied by a computer, and got used to not struggling with the world. Maybe because we have the same background â€” melancholy and pain from the depth of the universe. People: An additional person is an additional fork in the possibilities, and humans collectively make up a strangely colorful flower. This is where nature is serious, ruthless, rational, and marvelous. Because of this author, I became interested in the city of Xiamen. I must go and see.
