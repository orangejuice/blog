  subtitle: Melissa Macauley / 2021 / Princeton University Press
  intro: >-
    China has conventionally been considered a land empire whose lack of
    maritime and colonial reach contributed to its economic decline after the
    mid-eighteenth century. Distant Shores challenges this view, showing that
    the economic expansion of southeastern Chinese rivaled the colonial
    ambitions of Europeans overseas.

    In a story that dawns with the Industrial Revolution and culminates in the
    Great Depression, Melissa Macauley explains how sojourners from an
    ungovernable corner of China emerged among the commercial masters of the
    South China Sea. She focuses on Chaozhou, a region in the great maritime
    province of Guangdong, whose people shared a repertoire of ritual, cultural,
    and economic practices. Macauley traces how Chaozhouese at home and abroad
    reaped many of the benefits of an overseas colonial system without
    establishing formal governing authority. Their power was sustained instead
    through a mosaic of familial, fraternal, and commercial relationships spread
    across the ports of Bangkok, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and
    Swatow. The picture that emerges is not one of Chinese divergence from
    European modernity but rather of a convergence in colonial sites that were
    critical to modern development and accelerating levels of capital
    accumulation.

    A magisterial work of scholarship, Distant Shores reveals how the
    transoceanic migration of Chaozhouese laborers and merchants across a
    far-flung maritime world linked the Chinese homeland to an ever-expanding
    frontier of settlement and economic extraction.

Via tw Zoe Zoe 读完新年第一本书。潮汕人在东南亚“殖民”并不是传统意义上有军事力量支持的开疆拓土，而是纯粹的集体型的经济活动。然而，这种类型的“殖民”在经济上与社会层面上都是原住国在空间的拓展与流动。这种流动受原住国经济与政治影响很大。东南亚的发展离不开这些华人早年的艰辛努力。潮汕人的确坚忍与团结。
