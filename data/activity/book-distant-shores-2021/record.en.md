Via tw Zoe Zoe finished reading the first book of the New Year. The colonization of Southeast Asia by the Chaoshan people was not a traditional territorial expansion supported by military force, but a purely collective economic activity. However, this type of 'colonization' both economically and socially represented the spatial expansion and mobility of the native country. This mobility is greatly influenced by the native country's economy and politics. The development of Southeast Asia cannot be separated from the early relentless efforts of these Chinese. The Chaoshan people are indeed tenacious and united.
