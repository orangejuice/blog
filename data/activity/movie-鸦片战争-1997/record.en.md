The characters are three-dimensional, and the dialogues are exceptionally fascinating, presenting the contradictions and the era very aptly, blending in an abundant amount of melancholy. Some parts are surprisingly good, to the point of not seeming like a mainland work, why is it only rated 7.4? It deserves a score of 9. This dilapidated Qing paper boat, fearful of foreigners on one side and of a slave rebellion on the other, constantly on guard against the public, how can it bear the great responsibility of educating all ethnic groups of China? It's impossible that it could lead Chinese culture to prosperity. On the contrary, it is willing to measure China's resources to please other countries.
