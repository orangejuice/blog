The characters are well-rounded, and the dialogues are extremely brilliant, portraying the conflicts and the era very aptly, blending with a lot of mournful emotions. There are surprises, surprisingly good for a mainland production, how it only got a 7.4 when a 9 would not be too much. This derelict Qing dynasty 'paper boat,' fearful of foreigners on one hand and slave revolts on the other, meticulously vigilant against the public, how can it bear the responsibility of educating the various ethnic groups of China, impossible to lead Chinese culture towards prosperity, instead willingly use China's resources to please foreign powers.
