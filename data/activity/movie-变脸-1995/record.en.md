Zhu Xu truly possesses masterful acting skills, this lovely old man who's packed with charisma - the climax wouldn't hold up without him, providing a striking contrast backdrop for the artist. A small figure, dedicated to his craft, wanders the world, portraying the good and bad of traditional values, expressing both the warmth and melancholy experienced by those living within. It gives a taste of all aspects of life before dramatic changes in China. The not-so-obvious backdrop of an impending end of an era also brings a mix of feelings. The young actors performed surprisingly well in several scenes. This is actually a film that has been shown globally.
