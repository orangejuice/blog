  title: Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It
  subtitle: Maile Meloy / 2009 / Riverhead
  intro: >-
    Meloy’s first return to short stories since her critically acclaimed debut,
    Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It is an extraordinary new work from one of
    the most promising writers of the last decade.

    Eleven unforgettable new stories demonstrate the emotional power and the
    clean, assured style that have earned Meloy praise from critics and devotion
    from readers. Propelled by a terrific instinct for storytelling, and
    concerned with the convolutions of modern love and the importance of place,
    this collection is about the battlefields—and fields of victory—that exist
    in seemingly harmless spaces, in kitchens and living rooms and cars. Set
    mostly in the American West, the stories feature small-town lawyers,
    ranchers, doctors, parents, and children, and explore the moral quandaries
    of love, family, and friendship. A ranch hand falls for a recent law school
    graduate who appears unexpectedly— and reluctantly—in his remote Montana
    town. A young father opens his door to find his dead grandmother standing on
    the front step. Two women weigh love and betrayal during an early snow.
    Throughout the book, Meloy examines the tensions between having and wanting,
    as her characters try to keep hold of opposing forces in their lives:
    innocence and experience, risk and stability, fidelity and desire.

    Knowing, sly, and bittersweet, Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It confirms
    Maile Meloy’s singular literary talent. Her lean, controlled prose, full of
    insight and unexpected poignancy, is the perfect complement to her
    powerfully moving storytelling.
