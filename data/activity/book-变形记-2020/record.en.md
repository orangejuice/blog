Via tw piglei, I read 'Metamorphosis' as a child. I didn't understand much then, thinking how a living person could turn into a beetle. I wondered what it was all about and didn't find it appealing. Recently, while commuting, I've been re-listening to 'Metamorphosis'. The story of that travelling salesman who woke up transformed into a giant beetle still gives me chills. Classic literature is really terrifying; even if it didn't hit you 20 years ago, there's no guarantee it won't jump out from some corner one day and catch you off guard.
