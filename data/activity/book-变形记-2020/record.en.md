Via tw piglei As a child when I read 'The Metamorphosis', I didn't understand much, wondering how a living person could transform into a beetle. What kind of writing is this? Not good, not good. These days, while commuting, I relistened to 'The Metamorphosis', still following the story of the traveling salesman who wakes up transformed into a giant beetle. But this time, it sent chills down my spine.

Classic literature can be truly terrifying. Even if it didn't strike you 20 years ago, you never know when it might burst from a corner unexpectedly and catch you off guard.
