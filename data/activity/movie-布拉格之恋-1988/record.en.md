An epic novel on film. Understanding of sexuality and changes in the social context form the foundation for the characters and their destinies. The reactions to this film taught me about the light and heavy in my eyes. A happy life of love is beautiful, desirable, and worthwhile. An unhappy, unloved life is dark, meaningless, and not worth living. The female lead's painful despair is almost suffocating, but it gradually improves after she moves to a secluded manor. In the finale, I so wished they had kept driving or even fled the country, and the so-called death notice was nothing but smoke and mirrors.
