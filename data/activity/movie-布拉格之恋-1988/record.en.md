An epic cinematic novel. Understanding of sexuality and changing social backgrounds form the basis of the characters' personalities and fates. Watching this movie made me understand the light and heavy in my eyes. The life of being loved and happy is beautiful, desirable, and worth it. Life unloved and unhappy is dark, meaningless, and not worth it. The protagonist's pain was almost suffocating in its despair, but gradually improved after moving to an estate in the countryside. At the ending, I really wished they kept driving or even ran out of the country, with the so-called death notice merely a distraction as part of a plan.
