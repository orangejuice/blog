Like Sun Yuchen, I was influenced by the American capitalist philosopher Ayn Rand. I read 'Atlas Shrugged' during my teenage years, and after reading this book, I became completely obsessed with money. The only time I showed any emotion was when I was counting money. After reading it, I became a snob throughout my teenage years. Everyone I dealt with was either rich or noble. At the core, I believed that money is the purest trading tool invented by humans. I prioritized benefits over all else and was extremely indifferent and selfish.
