Via Twitter liberalism, like Justin Sun, I was influenced by the American capitalist philosopher Ayn Rand. During my teenage years at fourteen or fifteen, I read 'Atlas Shrugged'. After finishing this book, I became solely focused on money, only serious about gold and silver, and showed emotions only when counting money. Following that, my entire teenage years turned into a materialistic phase, interacting only with the rich and powerful, and deeply believing that money is the purest tool of trade invented by mankind. Self-interest above all, with ultimate indifference and selfishness.
