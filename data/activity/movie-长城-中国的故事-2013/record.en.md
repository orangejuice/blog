I watched half of the first episode, and it is full of intense local flavor with colorful vocals and a barrage of photographic material. The modeling, mapping, and material textures are stuck in a decade ago. The camera movements and scores are whimsical, the color grading is surreal and exaggerated. The constant use of fast and slow motion techniques seems messy and displays a lack of skill. It's all very overwhelming, making it impossible to focus on the content. Looking at it from another perspective, it actually highlights some harsh realities - anxiety, eagerness for quick success, formalism, lack of artistic cultivation and ideal pursuits, and inadequate expressive ability. It is a representation of the times - 'existence is reasonable.' Remembering the lessons learned, I should stop blindly exploring unpopular documentaries and believe in the saying, 'good wine needs no bush.'
