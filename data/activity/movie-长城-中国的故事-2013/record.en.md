I watched half of the first episode. It pursues a rustic form with splendid vocal clamor while piling up cinematographic materials. The modeling textures and materials are stuck a decade ago. The cinematography and music follow no rules; the color grading is exaggerated and unnatural, with constant use of fast and slow motions, making it seem messy and desperate. It's dazzling and utterly distracts from the content. On the other hand, it accidentally highlights some side truths, depicting anxiety, haste for success, formalism, lack of artistic culture and aspiration, and inadequate expression skillsâ€”all very reflective of our era. Existence is reasonable, and it is highly representative of our times. Remember the lesson: stop blindly exploring unpopular documentaries. Believe in the notion that a good wine does not fear a deep alley.
