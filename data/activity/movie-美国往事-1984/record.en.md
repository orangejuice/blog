      comment: A peculiar film, starting and ending in an opium den. Growth, life and
        death, love, departure, friendship, betrayal, escape, guilt are all real
        memories, but the betrayal's prosperity, reunion, redemption, truth, and
        the relief after knowing the truth are illusions induced by opium.
        Americans have a saying, 'Age will flatten a man'. The older you get,
        the less courage remains from your youthful triumphs over fate, these
        memories and illusions become clearer, like the dream-like feeling
        'Noodles' had in the opium den. Everyone who has experienced life's ups
        and downs has their own psychological opium den.

The 4-hour length really tests one's concentration. I don't understand why the score is so high; by the end, I hardly felt moved or left with anything impactful, just felt relief that it was finally over. Compared to the adults' betrayals and schemes, I only liked the childhood stories, the experiences of the children in the early 20th century, their loves and friendships, and the streets and lifestyle of New York. The unique charm of the old era.
