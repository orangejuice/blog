      comment: "via Twitter by The Walking Rider: A peculiar movie that begins and
        ends in an opium den. Growth, life and death, love, separation,
        friendship, betrayal, escape, guilt are all vivid memories. The success
        after betrayal, reunions, redemption, the truth, and the release upon
        learning the truth are all hallucinations produced after consuming
        opium. There's an American saying, 'Age will flatten a man.' As one
        grows older, the courage of youth to overcome fate diminishes, making
        these memories and illusions clearer, just like 'Noodles' dreamy
        sensation in the opium den. Everyone who has endured the ups and downs
        of life has their own psychological opium den."

This four-hour epic really tests one's focus. I don't understand why the ratings are so high, as I hardly felt moved by anything by the end, only relieved that it was finally over. Compared to the adults' betrayal and scheming, I only liked the childhood stories from the early 20th centuryâ€” the kids' backgrounds, love and friendships, as well as the streets and lifestyle of New York. The unique charm of the old era.
