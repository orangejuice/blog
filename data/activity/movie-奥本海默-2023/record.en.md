The emotional and political drama is thin, with characters going to bed upon meeting and being depicted as shadowy forces instantly—a needless portrayal often seen during conference scenes where Oppenheimer and his lover engage in love-making. This part carries a heavy imprint of brainless commercial pandering to the market. Aside from that, everything else is quite good. The most crucial aspect—Oppenheimer's portrayal by the actor is impressive; the character remains vivid within the constrained narrative space. His lean cheeks, tall stature, dressed in a black suit, hat, and smoking a black pipe. The climax from the deployment to the explosion of the atomic bomb is truly spectacular, heart-stopping, conveying a sense of solitude amidst a celebrating crowd, maximizing empathy. These scenes alone make the movie worth watching.
