The emotional and political drama is sparse; the characters would jump into bed upon meeting, adversaries are merely the dark forces, and the poetic cutaway of Oppenheimer making love with his lover on the conference table is quite unnecessary, superfluous. This part's simplistic commercial treatment for market appeal leaves a heavy imprint. Other aspects are good. The most important part—the actor’s portrayal of Oppenheimer is great, the character is still vibrant even within the narrow narrative space. Thin cheeks, tall thin body, black suit, black hat, black pipe. From the deployment to the explosion of the atomic bomb, the climax is extraordinarily thrilling, heart-stoppingly so. Among the celebrating crowd, he stands alone, filled with sorrow, while our empathy is off the charts. These scenes alone make the movie worth watching.
