Via tw Jacobson “High competition not only keeps one's will and muscles under excessive tension continuously, but such a life can only be sustained for a generation or two at most. Those who have experienced this kind of life will certainly become neurasthenic, seek various ways to escape, and even their time for leisure and entertainment will be as tense and difficult as work (because they are no longer able to relax), eventually perishing without being able to reproduce.” —Bertrand Russell, The Road to Happiness
