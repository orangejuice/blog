As quoted by Jacobson, 'The high degree of competition not only keeps one's will and muscles excessively tense, this kind of life can only last for one or two generations at most. People who have experienced this kind of life will definitely suffer from neurasthenia and seek various ways to escape. Even the time for leisure and recreation will be as tense and difficult as work (because they can no longer relax) and finally disappear due to inability to reproduce.' —Russell, The Road to Happiness
