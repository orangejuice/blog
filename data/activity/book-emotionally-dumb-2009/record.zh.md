  title: Emotionally Dumb
  subtitle: Jason Thompson / 2009
  intro: >-
    Alexithymia is an inability to identify and describe both one's own, and
    other people's emotions. Although individuals with alexithymia display the
    typical physical responses associated with emotions - such as tears,
    butterflies in the stomach or an increased heart rate - they are unable to
    recognize these responses in terms of the emotions they might be signifying.

    Emotionally Dumb describes the nature of alexithymia and includes
    therapeutic and self-help suggestions for overcoming some of the
    difficulties that alexithymia presents. The author discusses the possible
    causes and associated conditions, including Asperger Syndrome and
    posttraumatic stress disorder. The book provides details of the diagnostic
    tests available and includes an informal questionnaire, developed by the
    author, for people who believe they may have alexithymia.

    Written in accessible language, this book is ideal both for professionals
    and for anyone with an interest in the subject.
