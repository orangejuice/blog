Via Twitter @immusoul #FilmReview Martin McDonagh's new film is a must-see, as his previous film 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' was the best film of that year. It did not disappoint after watching; this film is truly worth pondering over, even to the extent that I can't easily summarize it in a few sentences. I searched online and found that most people focused on the male friendship, which I disagree with.
