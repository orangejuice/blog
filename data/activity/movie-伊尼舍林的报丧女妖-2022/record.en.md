Via tw immusoul #MovieReview Martin McDonagh's new film is a must-see, as his last film 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' was the best movie of that year. After watching, I wasn't let down, this movie is worth pondering, to the point where I can't simply summarize it in a few words. I searched online and found most people focused on male friendships, which I disagree with.
