This season feels quite complex, mixing impatience with naive sentimentality, a bit of contemplation, and a sense of unanchored loss of control over thinking and the value of life. There are episodes filled with fluff and others with disjointed, incoherent plot events, but after watching it all, I still decided to give it a score of 5. Today's sci-fi narrative tends to converge and standardize, the ultimate human imagination of the future is aligning. Will the future, aided by the perfected systems of human technology, be as humans imagine today, or will it remain primitive and deficient? Regardless, watching this still makes me feel melancholic, partly because I regret how tightly life traps me, preventing my soul from awakening and being free. Watching a reticent, self-effacing loner ascend to a divine cosmic sovereign even though itâ€™s merely wishful thinking, one cannot help but feel poignantly moved.
