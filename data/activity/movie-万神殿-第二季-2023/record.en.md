The feelings of this season are somewhat complex, involving impatience, na√Øve emotions, a bit of contemplation, and a sense of unanchored and out of control thinking about the meaning and value of life. I believe there are elements of filler and incongruous jumps in the storyline, but after watching, I still decided to rate it 5 out of 5. Current Sci-Fi tends to have similar and unified thought processes, our ultimate imagination of the future is syncing up. Will the future truly be as we imagine, where due to mankind's technological development tends towards perfection? Or will our technology remain primitive and our imaginations lacking? Regardless, after watching, I still felt sorrowful. Part of it was regret that I am trapped by life, that my soul has never awakened or been free. Seeing the transformation from a silent and shy outcast to the ruler of the universe, makes me melancholy though I know it's just motivational fiction.
