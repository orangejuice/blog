The Chinese title, '寻子遇仙记' which translates to 'The Kid Meets the Fairy', is quite fitting. It includes both a beautiful, pure fantasy and a heartbreaking reality. The dream scenarios, achieved through primitive special effects, have highlighted the human fantasy of a beautiful world. Devil's temptations have turned the harmony of human communities upside down. The film is humorous and straightforward, with a poignant scene where the mother and child reunite. It contrasts between wealth and poverty, beauty and ugliness, features a unique performance style, and a happy ending, all of which took birth exactly a hundred years ago.
