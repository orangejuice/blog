The Chinese name 'The Quest for the Child Encounters the Immortal' is quite meaningful. It embodies both the beauty of pure fantasy and the bitterness of reality, highlighting the dreamy characteristics of people's imagined beautiful world through primitive special effects. The temptation of the devil makes the human community less harmonious and pure. The movie is humorous and the plot is straightforward. The scene where the mother meets her son is genuinely moving. The contrast between the rich and the poor, beauty and ugliness, coupled with a unique performance style, and a wonderful ending, born exactly a hundred years ago.
