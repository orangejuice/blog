Bit by bit, finally, a month later at twilight, amidst the rain and the grogginess of just waking up, I finished the last sentence of the last chapter. Its status as one of the 125-year bests of the "New York Times" is quite fitting, thought-provoking and profound in experience. Childhood growth is an eternal topic, and through the author's keen sensitivities, it also reveals aspects and atmospheres beyond one's own reach.
