No book elucidates the fundamental risks of Chinese socio-economic structure better than this one. No other book serves as a better political allegory for China's future. No other book clarifies the relationship between reform and revolution as well as this one. This is the book personally recommended by the former Vice President of the State, Wang Qishan. This is Alexis de Tocqueville's 'The Old Regime and the Revolution'. Written in 1856, each viewpoint in this book has nearly become a timeless classic; written in 1856, every classic thought resonates like contemporary commentary.
