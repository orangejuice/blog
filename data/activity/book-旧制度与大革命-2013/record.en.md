There is no book that better illustrates the fundamental risks of China's social economy than this one

There is no other book that could better serve as a political allegory for China's future

There is no other book that can clarify the relationship between reform and revolution more clearly

This is a book personally recommended by the former vice president, Wang Qishan

This is Alexis de Tocqueville's "The Old Regime and The Revolution"

Every point of view in this book, written in 1856, has nearly become a timeless classic;

Every classic in this book, written in 1856, reads like current affairs commentary
