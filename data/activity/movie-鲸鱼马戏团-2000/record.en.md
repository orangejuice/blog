Via Twitter Morgan and Béla Tarr, I passionately watched 'Sátántangó,' which is seven hours long, but 'Whale Circus,' only being two hours long, made me feel bored halfway through. His long takes and mise-en-scène are exceptionally powerful, undeniable from the very first shot which was truly mesmerizing. However, watching the same shot for five minutes straight certainly tests one's focus, especially when the shot conveys little information. Halfway through, my mind just zoned out not knowing what to think anymore. I'm not very familiar with Hungary's history, but aren't we all aware of what life under a totalitarian regime looks like? The hopeless resistance of the underprivileged, the breeding of violence, but when you see these frail elderly people who are just like them, they turn into sheep in wolf's clothing. The pianist also attempted to abandon equal temperament to liberate music, but eventually, when he was driven out of his home to live in the kitchen by the police chief and his ex-wife, he still retuned the piano for money.
