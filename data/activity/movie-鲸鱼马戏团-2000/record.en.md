Courtesy of Morgan and Béla Tarr, I managed to passionately watch through the seven-hour long 'Satan's Tango', but halfway through this two-hour 'Whale Circus', I began to feel bored. His long shots and scheduling are both very, very impressive, which no one can deny. I was shocked from the very first shot. However, watching the same shot for five minutes straight really tests one's mental concentration, especially when there isn't much information conveyed in that shot. Halfway through, my mind had already blanked out, unsure of what I was thinking about. I'm not very familiar with Hungary's history, but we're all aware of what life is like in an autocratic country, right? The hopeless resistance of the lower classes, the rise of violence, but seeing these gaunt elderly people who are just like them, they turn into harmless sheep in wolf's skin. The pianist also attempted to abandon the twelve-tone equal temperament to liberate music, but when he was finally evicted by the police chief and his ex-wife and had to live in the kitchen, he resorted to tuning his piano again just to make money.
