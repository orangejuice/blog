Via tw viking, the book describes the exhausting life of the author and her mother taking care of her father after his stroke. A pacemaker kept him alive as he slowly succumbed to dementia, incontinence, and near muteness, eventually just sitting and waiting to die. It was particularly moving when her mother finally voiced a thought that had been suppressed in everyone's heart: 'When will your father finally die? Our lives are ruined.'

Those who have cared for the sick may relate. One should first clarify their attitude towards death as they approach middle and old age. The mother in the story eventually forgoes heart surgery, choosing a natural death instead.

A short review on Douban says, 'Modern medicine's excessive intervention has made it increasingly difficult for people to die well. You also fail to realize whether a doctorâ€™s decision on surgery and medication is truly for the patient's benefit or profit-driven. A sudden, healthy death should be a moment of bliss.'
