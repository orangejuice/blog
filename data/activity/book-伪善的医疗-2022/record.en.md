Via tw viking, this book narrates the author's exhausting life of taking care of her mother and her stroke-stricken father, whose life is sustained by a pacemaker. Gradually, he falls into dementia, incontinence, and near-muteness, finally only being able to sit waiting for death. What moved me was when her mother finally voiced out the question everyone had been holding in their hearts: 'When is your father going to finally pass away? Our lives have been ruined.' I think those who have cared for the sick can empathize. I believe that the first thing a person should do when they reach middle age is to clarify their attitude towards death. The mother in the story eventually gave up heart surgery and chose natural death. A short review on Douban: 'The excessive intervention of modern medicine has made it increasingly difficult for more and more people to die a good death. You never really understand whether the doctor's judgment of surgery and medication is due to the patient's suitability or profit. A sudden death in good health should be a joyful event.'
