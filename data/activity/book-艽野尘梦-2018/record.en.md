Via tw Uncle Li, among the books I have read, there are many good ones, but only a few can be called extraordinary. 'Wilderness Dust Dreams' is one of them. I first came across this book when a fellow traveler recommended it to me during my first backpacking trip along the Yunnan-Tibet route. It's very captivating. The author is Chen Quzhen, a military and literary figure from western Hunan during the late Qing and early Republican era. He graduated from the Hunan Military Academy and followed Zhao Erfeng, the governor of Sichuan, into Tibet to suppress a rebellion. However, with the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution, Zhao was called back to Sichuan and met his demise in Chengdu. Left leaderless in Tibet, the Sichuan army mutinied under the influence of the Elder Brothers Society. Left with no choice, Chen Quzhen led 115 soldiers through the uninhabited region of Qiangtang, over the Tanggula Mountains back to the mainland, a harrowing seven-month journey which saw them out of food and with countless deaths and injuries, finally arriving in Xining, Qinghai in June 1912 with only seven soldiers surviving. 'Wilderness Dust Dreams' chronicles this painful experience.
