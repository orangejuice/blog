Via Twitter user 'Second Uncle': Among the books I've read, there are many good ones, but there are not many that can be described as extraordinary. 'Dreams of Wild Grasses and Dust' is one of them. This book was recommended to me by a fellow traveler I ran into during my first backpacking trip along the Yunnan-Tibet route. It's really engaging. The author is Chen Quzhen, a military officer and warlord from Western Hunan during the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China era. This man was truly adept in both literary and martial arts. He graduated from Hunan Military Academy and followed Zhao Erfeng, the governor of Sichuan, into Tibet to suppress a rebellion. However, in the midst of this, the Xinhai Revolution broke out and Zhao Erfeng was recalled to Sichuan, where he died in Chengdu. The Sichuan Army left in Tibet was leaderless and instigated by the Gelaohui to rebel. Chen Quzhen had no choice but to lead his troops of 115 men, trek through the uninhabited Qiangtang region, cross the Tanggula Mountains, and return to the mainland. They struggled for more than seven months, ran out of food, suffered countless casualties, and finally reached Xining, Qinghai in June 1912 with only seven soldiers left alive. 'Dreams of Wild Grasses and Dust' documents this painful journey.
