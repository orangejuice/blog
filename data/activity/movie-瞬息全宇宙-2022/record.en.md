I watched it yesterday. I am not interested in this absurd and bizarre method of storytelling, the logically lacking stage performance is devoid of realism that allows me to engage emotionally. Many hot topics and concepts have been stuffed into it, including the eye-catching issue of Asian family, but the film itself couldn't move me. Despite all the absurd chaos and dazzling lights, the silent discussion of two stones on a desert cliff calmed me down.
