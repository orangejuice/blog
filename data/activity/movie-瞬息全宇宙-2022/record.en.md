I watched it yesterday and I’m not a fan of such absurd and bizarre narratives. The artificially constructed, illogical stage performance severely lacks the realism needed to evoke my emotions. They’ve crammed in a bunch of hot topics and ideas, including the striking issues of Asian-American families, but the movie itself did not move me. Amidst the nonsensical noise and dazzling lights, the silent discussion between two rocks on a desert cliff somehow calmed me down.
