Movies like 'Kwaidan', directed by Masaki Kobayashi in 1965, and 'Dreams', directed by Akira Kurosawa in his later years, truly belong to the category of bizarre movies that I can't resist. Even for 'Fitzcarraldo', which is forever number one in my film history, I would not watch it as many times, and it never gets old. 

I can't exactly articulate why I like bizarre things so much. In fact, I neither like horror movies nor surrealistic movies. But Japanese bizarre movies seem to just fulfill all my imagination of East Asian history. 

When East Asians tell tales of ghosts and monsters, it’s not merely for sensory stimulation, because they always contain profound friendships and vivid moral ethics. Ghosts and monsters are more humane than humans. Perhaps the ideal state of being a human is to become a ghost or monster.
