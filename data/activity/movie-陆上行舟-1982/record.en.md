In the same regard to movies like 'Kwaidan' by Masaki Kobayashi in 1965 and Akira Kurosawa's later works like 'Dreams', they are amongst the films I find most irresistibly bizarre. Even 'Fitzcarraldo', which I consider the greatest film of all time in my eyes, I wouldn’t watch it as many times, yet I never tire of it.

I can't quite explain why I love bizarre things so much. Actually, I neither like horror movies nor am I a fan of surrealism. But somehow, Japanese bizarre cinema perfectly satisfies my imagination about East Asian history.

East Asians telling ghost and monster stories isn't just for sensory stimulation, because it always involves profound affection and clear moral ethics. Ghosts and monsters seem to have more humanity than humans. Perhaps the ideal state of being for a person is to become a ghost or a monster.
