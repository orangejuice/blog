Via Twitter user Tingyun - I read Professor Dong Mei's new book from CAFA. From the first page, I was captivated, 'The Dream of the Red Chamber itself is as though brewed from a cask of Chinese characters into a rich and fragrant wine. It is crafted using the yeast of millennia of Chinese culture, mixed with the seasons of the Chinese people's lives—spring, summer, autumn, winter—along with their joys, anger, sorrows, and contemplations, to produce something exquisitely refined.' Yes indeed, behind all mediums lies the art of language and humanity. Through a dream, one sees heaven, earth, and the human world coming and going so vividly.
