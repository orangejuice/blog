Via tw Stopping Clouds, I read the new book by Professor Dong Mei from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the first page attracted me, "'Dream of the Red Chamber' itself is a fragrant wine fermented from Chinese characters. It is brewed with thousands of years of Chinese culture as the yeast, intertwined with the spring, summer, autumn, and winter of the Chinese people and their joy, anger, sorrow, and joy. All behind the various media is the art of language and people. Through a dream, we see the coming and going yet genuine heaven, earth, and people.
