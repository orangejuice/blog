via Twitter 'Searching All Over for the Ball' has read 'Hustle and Bustle of the Town,' which is a recommended book from the series 'Involved in the Affairs.' The author conducts field research in the most basic governmental unitsâ€”the towns and townships, explaining the dynamics among town government officials, village cadres, and villagers through actual cases. The description is vivid. The countryside has its own operating logic, where all parties use the law as a tool to seek outcomes favorable to themselves, and recourse to law might be even more costly.
