I read 'Small Town Bustle' via tw 'Searching for the Ball Everywhere', which was recommended in 'In the Midst of Affairs.' The author investigates the most basic units of governmentâ€”townships and accomplishes field research, elucidating the games between town government officials, village leaders, and villagers in actual case studies. It's quite alive. Villages have their own operating logic, and all parties use the law as a tool to seek favorable outcomes for themselves. Resorting to the law may actually result in higher costs.
