The film attempts to depict the raw hue of life, a cast of notable figures, and a bevy of beauties. Affection, ideals, friction, pure love and hate, a sense of lost emptiness are all manifested. The story is told calmly, with a simple sense of the times. However, the sense of reality and contrivance are interwoven. On the one hand, it focuses on the contradictions of 'ordinary people's' lives. On the other hand, there are some seemingly ordinary yet bizarre behavior of uncommon characters—a daughter arranging three blind dates for herself, a boy genius who loves recording and editing sounds, a son who can cook eight large bowls of food in one go, a couple maintaining their relationship by playing with toys, and a woman offering her wrist to passing men on the street for perfume testing. The storytelling ability is not quite there, making it hard to resonate with the audience. If this was a longer film, it would be full of cliches. However, the film does evoke a slight heartache—a clumsy exploration of the soul and essence in these times.
