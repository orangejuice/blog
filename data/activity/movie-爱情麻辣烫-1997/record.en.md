Attempts to paint a true color of life with famous stars and beautiful women. Warmth, ideals, friction, simple love and hatred, and a sense of emptiness are all depicted. The story is told calmly with a straightforward sense of the era. Yet, there is an interweaving of realism and a sense of compilation, highlighting the contradictions in the lives of 'ordinary people' yet featuring unlikely characters - a daughter arranging three suitors for herself, a young genius who loves recording and editing sounds, a son who casually cooks eight large bowls of food, a couple who use toys to maintain their relationship, and a woman standing on the street offering wrist for perfume testing to passing men. The storytelling ability is insufficient, making it hard to resonate, and it turns into melodrama if stretched longer. Despite this, there remains a hint of poignancy - a clumsy exploration of the soul and essence of the era.
