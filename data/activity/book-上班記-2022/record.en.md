Mr. He Zhaowu's 'Work Diary' is well written and a true delight to read. Many facts are on display, yet only he is willing to put them down in black and white. What's most interesting is that he specializes in the history of thought and philosophy of history, showing exceptional logical thinking. There are many amusing topics discussed logically, as absurd as a clown marching in a nude parade.
