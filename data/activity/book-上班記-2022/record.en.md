Via Twitter, Song Ma praises He Zhaowuâ€™s 'Work Diary' for being exceptionally well-written, capturing many obvious truths that only he dares to clearly express. Most interestingly, his background in the history of thought and philosophical history endows him with remarkable logical thinking abilities. Discussing matters logically with him can be as hilariously absurd as a nude clown parading.
