Via tw mier Just read "A Whole Life", similar to when I read "Stoner" and "The Remains of the Day" previously, though the scope of the story is different, they all tell the tale of an older person reflecting on their life. I can't resist these kinds of stories, I often find myself on the verge of tears while reading them. I don't know if it's because I'm too old or too young. Sigh.
