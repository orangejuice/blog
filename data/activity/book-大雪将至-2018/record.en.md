Via tw mier Just read "Snow is Coming," and just like when I read Stoner and The Remains of the Day, although the story scales differ, they all talk about an elderly person reflecting on their life. I'm completely helpless against these types of stories and often find myself crying as I read. I don't know if it's because my mindset is too old or too young. Sigh.
