Parkinson's lens stays flat on the ground and keeps shaking, the portrayal of characters is not gripping, very thin cannot hold up the plot and actions, making people unable to get into the play. The only highlight rarely seen in domestic films is the makeup effects on the battlefield. I forced myself to watch half of it, I really didn't want to waste time watching the second half. High praise is said to be mature work, my feeling is just the opposite.
