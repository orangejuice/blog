Parkinson's camera shakes incessantly even on flat ground, the characterization fails to grasp the essence, very thin, unable to support the plot and actions, making it hard to engage with the film. The only standout aspect seldom seen in domestic films is the battlefield make-up effects. I forced myself through the first half, and really didn't want to waste more time on the latter half. Highly reviewed as a mature work, but my experience feels quite the opposite.
