Via translator Christopher Banana, I briefly skimmed through Angela Carter's 'Black Venus'. Wow, what a talented woman! Her writing is succinct, vibrant, yet magical (∪ ●`)

And the likes of Uncle Lin, even after reading Angela's works, can only think 'Aha! This sentence! It can be used to punch the faces of Twitter feminists!'

Being born male is indeed a lifelong misfortune due to an inherent disability.
