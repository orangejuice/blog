The pace is slow, very slow. The story is full of flavors, singing a different tune from modern society, telling you that you can be calm, stubborn, clumsy, and unchanging for decades. What is missed will be mercilessly missed, what is deserved will quietly come. The vicissitudes of twelve years seem like a moment, causing heartache. The state of mind reflected in this film is enviable.
