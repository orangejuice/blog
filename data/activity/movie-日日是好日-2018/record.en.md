With a slow pace, very slow indeed. The story is flavorful, presenting a narrative that diverges from modern society norms, suggesting that one can remain calm and stubborn, clumsy, and consistent over decades. What is missed will be heartlessly missed, and what is deserved will silently arrive. Twelve years change as if in a blink, touching one's heart. The mindset reflected in this film is enviable.
