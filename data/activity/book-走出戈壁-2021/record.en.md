Great book. The author's experiences and his calm, rational pen have turned this into a rare historical piece. The deepest impression after reading is the author's philosophy of life. Although there is no clear grand aim, he has always been committed to living the present life well, maintaining the rationality of the present state of mind and choices, and making adequate preparations for the future. This is specifically manifested in his hard work and social popularity in the Gobi. The author's complex and profound nostalgia for the life in the Gobi makes the description in the first half more vivid and attractive, while the second half lacks some coherence. The feeling that the whole story gives is that many details have been omitted in the middle, and there are few emotional changes. Overall, I greatly appreciate the author's attitude towards life. The records in this book are also precious, inspiring, and serve as an unforgettable historical memory that can explain certain things.
