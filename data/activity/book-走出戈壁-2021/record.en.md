A fine book. The author's experiences and his calm, rational writing style make for a rare historical work. After finishing it, what resonates most is the author's philosophy of life: although he doesn't have clear, grand goals, he always passionately and vigorously lives in the moment, maintaining a rational mindset and making decisions that prepare him well for the future. This is evident in his industriousness and competence in the Gobi, which earns him the favor of many. The author's complex, profound nostalgia for life in the Gobi makes the first half of the description more vivid and engaging, while the latter half lacks some coherence. The narrative feels like it omits many details and is somewhat unemotional. Overall, I greatly admire the author's attitude towards life; the records in this book are a precious and inspirational testament to some unforgettable historical memories.
