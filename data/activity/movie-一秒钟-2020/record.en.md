The only highlight is Teacher Fan and his cinema. It has a personal style and a sense of the times and the characters. The interaction with the audience is also very interesting, hence the two-star. The news broadcast on the 22nd newsletter is also interesting. As for the others... The lead actor is not good, he can't hold up the character, only able to shout with wide-open eyes, and he and the young actress are simply two treasures, letting people make a big fuss. The final solo performance by the actress is also inexplicably contrived, artificially dramatic, and even specially provides a wipes-tears shot, which is laughable and directly aroused the impulse to give negative points. As a leading director, handing over such a work against the background of this serious historical period to promote actors and eat popular fast food is frivolous and ideal-less, failing, irresponsible, and disappointing. What's the point of an easter egg? Even if you add that easter egg to this movie, it still fails. The hard part is the character performance and the thin main theme of the story. It is all thanks to the brilliant performance of Fan's movie that I can continue to watch. Do you think you are innocent and should be tolerated just by scraping through censorship? Pah, so artificial.
