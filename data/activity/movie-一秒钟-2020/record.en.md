Mr. Fan and his cinema are the only highlights, possessing both personal style and a sense of the characters and era, with very interesting interactions with the audience. Both stars are for him. The news broadcast on the 22nd was also quite intriguing. As for the rest... The lead male actor is not up to the mark, unable to carry the role, only capable of widening his eyes and shouting. Paired with the young actress, both are laughably inept, providing more than enough drama. The final solo performance by the female actress was bizarre and affected, including a forced crying scene that was laughable, almost prompting a desire to give negative points. For a renowned director to produce such a work against this serious historical backdrop, supposedly to promote actors and cater to pop culture, it’s frivolous, lacks ideals, fails, irresponsible, and disappointing. Even adding some 'extracurricular surprise egg' does not redeem this movie, with its major flaws in character portrayal and a thin storyline. The only thing keeping it watchable is Mr. Fan’s outstanding performance in the cinema. Using censorship as an excuse for mediocrity, expecting tolerance? Ridiculous, such affectation.
