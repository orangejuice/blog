The narrative is particularly conservative, with a lack of novelty in the core story. Even the various aspects of tribal society resemble too closely a replication of early human society, and the wars greatly resemble the scenarios of human colonization. Despite not being a short film, time is well utilized with a proficient control over the pace, incorporating many elements. The confrontation between human and natural forces is striking, revealing the ugly side of humanity through the greedy old man, whose sickness evokes anger. The artistic aspect is mostly reflected in the visual creativity and effects. The dual imagination of technology and nature still attracts me greatly. One last quirk - these aliens, whether male or female, all follow human aesthetics and preferences. Also, why is green associated with the sea and blue with the land?
