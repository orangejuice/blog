The arrangement is particularly conservative and lacks innovation in its core narrative, almost replicating early human societies in every aspect of the tribal community, with the warfare eerily reminiscent of humanity's colonial expansions. Despite its length, the film makes good use of time, managing its pace skillfully and incorporating numerous elements. The confrontation between human and natural forces is striking, with a harsh exposure of humanity's uglier sides, notably a greedy old man whose morbid nature is enraging and daunting. The artistry lies almost entirely in visual creativity and effects, a dual imagining of technology and nature that still manages to captivate me. One critique, however, is that these aliens, whether male or female, seem to be designed entirely based on human aesthetics and preferences. Also, it's curious why green creatures live in the ocean and blue ones on land.
