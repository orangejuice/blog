Fell asleep watching it. The acting was stiff, the characters were thin, and the story was poorly developedâ€”thank God the music finally woke me up. Apart from the absurd historical background, there really isn't much else to see in the film. There were a few good lines, so I'll give it 1 point. The charming Taiwanese accent felt like watching Doraemon. / September 18 via lecturer recommendation
