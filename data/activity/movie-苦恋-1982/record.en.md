Fell asleep while watching. The acting was stiff, characters were thin, and the story was very poor. Thanks to the music that woke me up at the end. Apart from the absurdity of the historical background itself, there's really nothing else worth watching in the film. Some of the dialogues are not bad, for which I would give 1 point. The lovely Taiwanese accent keeps reminding me of Doraemon. / 9-18 via lecturer recommend
