I started watching with high expectations, but immediately felt it was quite average and gave up. Compared to Sekikawa, the difference is quite clear. The host’s demeanor and attire along with the content were all too frivolous, and the production lacked creativity. I didn't watch the rest, so I can't say much, but one star doesn't seem fitting.
