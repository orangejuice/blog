I started watching with great expectations, but was immediately disappointed and gave up. Compared to Sekikuchi, the difference is quite obvious. The host's manners, attire, and content all seem frivolous, and the production lacks originality. I didn't watch the rest so I don't know, thus I feel one star is not appropriate.
