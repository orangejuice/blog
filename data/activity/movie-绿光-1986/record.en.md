The flaws in one's character come in all shapes and sizes, and they manifest themselves in various forms. While these flaws do enrich the world, whether they are manifested or not, the inner struggle and agony, the awkwardness and sensitivity in interpersonal relationships have set an internal obstacle for the quality of life and the path to happiness. One can run all the way to exhaustion in life, but they are still alone, constituting part of the people. People who can understand and accept the female lead's character and actions are understandable, so are those who hate her. The only one I cannot understand is myself.
