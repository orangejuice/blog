The defects in personality are diverse, manifesting in various forms. Although they enrich the world, whether displayed or not, the inner turmoil and pain, along with the awkward sensitivities in social interactions, set internal obstacles on the path to quality of life and the pursuit of happiness. One may run through life exhausted only to end up alone, part of the masses. It is understandable for those who dislike or accept the protagonist’s character and actions, but alone, I do not understand myself.
