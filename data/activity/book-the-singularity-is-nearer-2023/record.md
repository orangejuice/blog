  title: The Singularity Is Nearer
  subtitle: Ray Kurzweil / 2023 / Viking
  intro: >-
    The noted inventor and futurist's successor to his landmark book The
    Singularity Is Near explores how technology will refashion the human race in
    the decades to come

    Since it was first published in 2005, Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near
    and its vision of the future have been influential in spawning a worldwide
    movement with millions of followers, hundreds of books, major films (Her,
    Lucy, Ex Machina), and thousands of articles. During the succeeding decade
    many of Kurzweil's predictions about technological advancements have been
    borne out, and their viability has become familiar to the public through
    such now commonplace concepts as AI, intelligent machines, and
    bioengineering.

    In this entirely new book Ray Kurzweil brings a fresh perspective to
    advances in the singularity—assessing the progress of many of his
    predictions and examining the novel advancements that, in the near future,
    will bring a revolution in knowledge and an expansion of human potential.
    Among the topics he discusses are rebuilding the world, atom by atom with
    devices like nanobots; radical life extension beyond the current age limit
    of 120; reinventing intelligence by expanding biological capacity with
    nonbiological intelligence in the cloud; how life is improving with declines
    in areas such as poverty and violence; and the growth of technologies such
    as renewable energy and 3-D printing, which can be applied to everything
    from clothes to building materials to growing human organs. He also
    considers the potential perils of biotechnology, nanotechnology, and
    artificial intelligence, including such topics of current controversy as how
    AI will impact unemployment and the safety of autonomous cars, and "After
    Life" technology, which will reanimate people who have passed away through a
    combination of data and DNA.

Via tw 硅谷王川 Kurzweil 上周刚出的新书，“奇点更近了”. 我最感兴趣的一章是关于人机合体和自我意识的讨论。这可能将是下一个范式转移的领域，应当发生于 2045年之前。到那一步时，现在的很多问题都会变成无关紧要的伪命题了。
