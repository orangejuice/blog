Via Silicon Valley's Wang Chuan on Twitter, Kurzweil's new book that just came out last week, 'The Singularity Is Nearer'. The chapter I'm most interested in is about cyborgs and the discussion of self-consciousness. This could be the area for the next paradigm shift and it should happen before 2045. By then, many of today's issues will become irrelevant fallacies.
