via Twitter by Michael Guo - Another unputdownable book. Mr. Huang has a rich and detailed knowledge of history, a gentle and meticulous writing style. His personal life anecdotes and the vicissitudes of the nation's fate compliment each other beautifully. Although the times are very different, reading this book feels like opening a window; rushing in is the land of my roots, and the youth in which I grew up.
