Via tw miachel guo, this is another captivating book. Mr. Huang's historical knowledge is rich and detailed, his writing is gentle and delicate, and the personal life experiences, anecdotes and the changes of the nation's destiny are mutually illuminated. The era is indeed different, but clearly, reading this book is like opening a window, and what rushes over is my homeland, my growing youth.
