Via Twitter user Ti Yun who is planning to re-read 'Things That Happen in the Ming Dynasty' recently, still remembers the feelings during the first read. In this book, I encountered many aspects of human nature, integrity, persistence, intelligence, greed, and betrayal. I was moved by many strangers, saw too many pursuits against all odds, glimpsed a corner of history, as if these people were performing again and again in front of my eyes. I know they are still preserved in the history books.
