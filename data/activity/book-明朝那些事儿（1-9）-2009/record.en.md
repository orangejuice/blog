Via Twitter from Ting Yun, who is planning to reread 'The Stories of Ming Dynasty' and still remembers the feelings from the first read. This book exposes many facets of human nature â€“ integrity, perseverance, intelligence, greed, betrayal. It brings emotions for many whom I've never met, displaying actions they knew were futile, offering a glimpse into a corner of history, as if these characters performed right before my eyes. I know they still exist within the pages of history books.
