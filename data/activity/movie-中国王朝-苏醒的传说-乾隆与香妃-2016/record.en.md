Such a lovely and gentle little historical story, the ability to tell stories with such patience really moves me. With such a solid foundation, my direct feeling is that by choosing a positive and singular perspective to explain in consideration of universal acceptance, it engages the audience's interest and curiosity, achieving its purposeâ€”thus there is no regret of mere flattery. In my old age, I hope to have the small anticipation each day after meals, to turn on the TV by the fireplace, watching a new episode of Chinese historical programs, spoken with such gentle tones.
