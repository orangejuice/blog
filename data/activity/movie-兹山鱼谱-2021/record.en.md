The theme is quite melancholic, but the earnest lives of endearing people provide some solace. The performance in Korean cinema exhibits Korean-specific qualities, particularly at the climax, where the expression of emotion seems restrained. The depth of Chinese historical knowledge among the cast seems impressive, which makes this substantial film all the more precious in the fast-food culture prevalent in 2021. The exploration feels somewhat shallow, overly applying modern perspectives and values directly onto the characters. Nonetheless, by today's standards, it also holds value as many people today might be hiding on Heishan Island, leading bleak and undistinguished lives. The societal and cultural framework is on a long journey of transformation, and we look forward to the day this transformation is complete, not just for ourselves but for everyone involved.
