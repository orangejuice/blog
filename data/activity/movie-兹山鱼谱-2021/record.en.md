The theme is very sad, but the efforts of lovely people to live life brings some consolation. Korean film performances have a Korean characteristic, especially in the climax, the expression of emotions is restrained. The team's foundation in Sinology seems quite good. In 2021, when fast-food culture is prevalent, such a profound movie makes people cherish it more. The discussion appears to be slightly shallow, directly applying modern perspectives and values to the characters. Of course, judging by today's standards also has value. Many people today may indeed be hiding on Heishan Island, living an obscure and unsophisticated life. The social cultural framework is on a long and lengthy path of transformation. Those who expect this day of completion, not just us.
