From douban Algernon's Bouquet: Slightly reminiscent of a Charlie Chaplin comedy, the performances also have a touch of humor; however, the core of the comedy is actually tragic. The cinematography captures the rebellion and awakening consciousness of the lower classes, particularly the struggles women undertake for their own destinies in that era, which was rarely seen.
