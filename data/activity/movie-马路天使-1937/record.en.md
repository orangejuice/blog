Via douban, Algernon's bouquet seems to have a bit of Charlie Chaplin's comedy vibe, the character performance has a touch of humor. However, the core of the comedy is actually a tragedy. The cinematographic language depicts the rebellion and awakening consciousness of the lower-class people, especially women's struggle for their own destiny, which was rare in that era.
