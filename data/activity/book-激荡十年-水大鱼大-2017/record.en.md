Via tw Left-hand Ink On the contemporary political and economic history of China, China Resources is a legendary company. It was founded by Zhou Enlai in 1938, originally as an underground transit station established by the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong. It is said the founding funds came from two gold bars of party membership dues. During the Liberation War, China Resources was the most important material procurement base for the CCP, owning its own fleet and establishing a transport route between Dalian in the northeast and Hong Kong. During the Korean War, it served as the sole secret passage, procuring a vast amount of military supplies for the country, earning the nickname "Red Purchaser". In the planned economy period, China Resources once acted as the general agent for nearly all Chinese exports to Hong Kong, becoming a core window for international trade at that time.
