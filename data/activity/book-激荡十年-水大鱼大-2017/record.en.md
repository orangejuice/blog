Via tw Left Hand Ink Stains In the contemporary political and economic history of China, China Resources is a legendary company. It was founded by Zhou Enlai in 1938 and was originally an underground transport station established by the Communist Party in Hong Kong. It is said that the founding funds came from two gold bars of party membership fee. During the Liberation War, China Resources was the most important material procurement base of the Chinese Communist Party. It had its own fleet and established shipping routes between Dalian in the Northeast and Hong Kong Island. During the Korean War, it was the only secret channel, and it procured a large amount of military supplies for the country, known as the 'Red Buyer'. During the planned economic period, China Resources once undertook the general agency of almost all the products exported to Hong Kong from China, becoming the core window of international trade at that time.
