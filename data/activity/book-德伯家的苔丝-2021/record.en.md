Via tw Stopping Cloud, I've finally finished reading 'Tess of the d'Urbervilles.' The classic written a century ago still beats all kinds of popular novels today. Tess is a tragic story, but Hardy doesn't make the reader feel sad or depressed, his tone is soothing. When describing the characters' mood, he uses the changes in the natural scenery to project their inner feelings. The lush and fertile summer farms, the cold and desolate plateaus in winter, all correspond to Tess's state of mind. A nearly perfect girl, beautiful, hardworking, kind, and independently bearing everything from her poor family, struggles in despair in the hegemonic masculinity of 19th century rural England. She finally chooses an extreme way to prove her pure and faithful love. Many people will blame the libertine d'Urbervilles who engulfed Tess into darkness. However, Tess's emerald 'willing to give her life for love' is also one of those pushing her towards tragedy. Limitations of the time make it impossible for us today to condemn the Victorians' definition of female purity. In contrast, some men in present-day China might still be living in that social era a century ago.
