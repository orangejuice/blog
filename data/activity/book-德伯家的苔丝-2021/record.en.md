Via Twitter Tingyun. Finally finished 'Tess of the d'Urbervilles', a classic written a century ago that still surpasses many popular novels of today.
Tess's story is a tragedy, but Hardy’s writing doesn’t make the reader feel mournful or oppressed. His tone is soothing, using the changing natural scenery to reflect the characters' inner feelings— summer's abundant, lush farms and winter's cold bleak highlands all mirror Tess’s emotional state.
A nearly perfect girl, beautiful, hardworking, kind, independently bearing the burden of her impoverished family. In 19th century rural England, amidst the male-dominated values, she struggled desperately and eventually chose an extreme way to prove her pure and faithful love. Many blame Alec d'Urberville, the libertine who entangled Tess in darkness, yet Tess’s endurance 'for the love of him she could risk her life' also pushes her toward tragedy. The constraints of the time prevent us from condemning Victorian England's definition of female purity, though some modern Chinese men might still be living in a social epoch a century past.
