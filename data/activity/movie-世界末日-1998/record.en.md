Grand, money-burning scenes, plot development full of unexpected twists, professional and exquisite camera movement, and one man's heroism saving the world at a crucial moment. The life of the common man is suddenly disrupted as he steps forward to become a hero. With humor, optimism, unity, and bravery, the American spirit will overcome any difficulty. Family emotions and love are sublimated in the face of disaster, not forgetting the beautiful vase that occasionally appears on the side. In the end, people around the world have returned to living a life filled with sunshine and happiness.
