Itâ€™s been a long time since we've seen a straightforward American blockbuster featuring grand, expensive scenes, a plot full of twists and surprises, professionally crafted camera movements, and a hero saving the world single-handedly at the crucial moment. Ordinary lives are abruptly disrupted as everyday men rise to the occasion and transform into heroic figures, embodying the humorous, optimistic, and brave American spirit that can overcome all obstacles. Family bonds and romance are elevated amidst the chaos while the stereotypical glamorous side character sporadically appears. In the end, the global population returns to a sunny and happy life.
