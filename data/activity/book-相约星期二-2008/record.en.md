Via tweet from 'Old White', the author Mitch most respects, Professor Morrie, in the last journey of his life, talked to Mitch about family, feelings, money, aging, and death. The book is full of wisdom about life, and from it, you can feel the calm and positive attitude towards life.

This is a person who has broken and crushed his whole life, condensing out life experiences. After reading, you understand a lot of truths and will avoid a lot of detours in the future life.

The book is calm and comfortable, like the winter sun, unforgettable.

'Tuesdays with Morrie' was also made into a movie, which received high ratings.
