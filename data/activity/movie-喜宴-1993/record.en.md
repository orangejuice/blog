Realized halfway through that I'd seen it once already. A poignant story of generations and people from both sides of the strait, home and abroad. The more you understand, the more you immerse yourself in the story, walking through the journey with Wai-Tung's parents, bringing me joy and sadness. Life fills our hearts with heavy troubles. This big reunion is a beautiful expectation, a distant expectation.
