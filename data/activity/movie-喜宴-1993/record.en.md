I only realized halfway through that I had already seen it once. This is a poignant story of two generations and people across three shores, both domestic and overseas. Being able to understand more, to immerse myself in the journey with Wai-Tung and his parents, makes me happy but also sad. Life fills our hearts with heavy burdens. This grand reunion represents a distant but wonderful hope.
