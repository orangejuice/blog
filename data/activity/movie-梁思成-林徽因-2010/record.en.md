The content is overly sensational, seductive, long-winded, and lacks rational refinement. The short and sharp 4-episode behind-the-scenes content is even more comfortable to watch than the main film, which ultimately convinced me to give a score of 5. The content of the 8th episode was a bit surprising. This documentary is worth watching both inside and out, with the 19th-century social changes and personal experiences seen from the early 20th century perspective. All in all, it is unexpectedly good.
