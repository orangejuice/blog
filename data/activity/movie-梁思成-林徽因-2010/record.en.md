The content is overly melodramatic and lengthy, lacking rational refinement and robust simplicity. The short and compelling 4-episode highlights are even more comfortable to watch than the main film, ultimately persuading me to give it a 5-star rating. The content in episode 8 was somewhat surprising. This documentary is worth watching both inside and out, considering the societal changes and personal experiences of the 19th century through the eyes of the early 20th century. Overall, it's unexpectedly good.
