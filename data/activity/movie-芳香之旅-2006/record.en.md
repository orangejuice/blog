This movie is patient without ambition, a methodically rounded long story that triumphs in capturing history and life, focusing on the sense of authenticity, as well as the passionate spirit and innocent, radiant eyes of the female protagonist prior to the 70s. Against the overwhelming backdrop of the Mao era, three people come together only to ultimately part ways. The fervor of the revolutionary era is overwhelming and suffocating. For an individual, birth is the first chapter, death is the final chapter, and several choices in between, along with several internal struggles, constitute the entirety of their fleeting journey.
