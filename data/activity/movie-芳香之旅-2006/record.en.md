This movie is patient without ambition, presenting a standard long tale that triumphs by capturing history and life. It emphasizes realism, along with the fiery spirit and naive yet expressive eyes of the female lead before the 1970s. Set against the massive and overwhelming backdrop of Mao's era, three people come together only to eventually go their separate ways. The bustling atmosphere of the revolutionary times, the helplessness, and the suffocating environment. For a person, birth is the first chapter and death the final; the few decisions and internal struggles in between shape all the hustle and bustle of life.
