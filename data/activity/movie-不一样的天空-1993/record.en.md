It's like watching a novel. The scenes unfold one by one, each action, every dialogue, all simplistic, without hysterics or glamour, just a narrative made of words. Life is one word, death is another, the pain and torment in between is almost too hard to capture in words. The American spirit behind the story is intense, distinctive, a narrative of love and freedom.
