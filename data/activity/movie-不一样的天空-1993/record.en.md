It's like reading a novel, with a scene by scene, action by action, and some conversations that are incredibly simple. There are no hysterics and no grandeur, just descriptions composed of some words. Life is a word, death is a word, the pain and torment in the middle, even seem to have no words. The American spirit behind the American story is extraordinarily strong and unique. It's all about love and freedom.
