Via tw Ding Bu'er, after all, most of the love in the world is misjudged. Either love is mistaken for the universe, or pets are confused with children, or the difference between kindness and harm is unclear. Either marriage is misunderstood as love, or work is mistaken for life, or the house is mistaken for the future. And your pain is, she misidentified the window, but did not misjudge you.
