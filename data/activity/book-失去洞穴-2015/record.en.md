Via tw Ding Buyi: Love in this world is often mistaken, like calling a deer a horseâ€”either mistaking a lover for the universe or confusing pets with children, or muddling kindness with harm. Itâ€™s either misunderstanding that marriage is love, thinking a job is life itself, or mistakenly believing a house represents the future. And your pain lies in her mistaking the window but never mistaking you. ğŸ“– | Han Lizhu "Lost Cave"
