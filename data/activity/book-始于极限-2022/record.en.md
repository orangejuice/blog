Via mia Book Excerpt
I still believe that it is better to be in love than not to be. Because in the playground of love, one can deeply learn about oneself and others. Love helps us understand our own desires, jealousy, the urge to control, selfishness, tolerance, and detachment. Love is a platform for struggle, where you must seize the other's self and give up your own. I never consider love to be an indulgent experience. In the process of love, we get hurt and hurt each other, thereby painstakingly discerning the boundaries of our self-defense that cannot be conceded to others, as well as the impenetrable boundaries of the other. I have always believed that love does not blind a person; on the contrary, love is a state of being "extremely lucid when facing the other, so much so that it appears utterly insane to onlookers."
