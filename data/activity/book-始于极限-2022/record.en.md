From Via mia's book excerpts: I still believe that it is better to talk about love than not to. Because in the game of love, people can deeply understand themselves and others. Love helps us understand our desires, jealousy, control, selfishness, tolerance, and detachment. Love is a platform for struggle. You have to seize the other's ego and give up your own. I never thought of love as an indulgent experience. During the process of love, we are hurt and we hurt each other. Through these difficult times, we painfully figure out the self-defense line that can't be given to others under any circumstances, and the self-boundary line that the other can't cross. I have always believed that love will not blind a person's eyes. On the contrary, love is a state of being extremely sober when facing the other, so that it appears extremely crazy in the eyes of others.
