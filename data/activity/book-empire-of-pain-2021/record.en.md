Dr. Wang just bought this book 'Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty's Pharmaceuticals Empire'. Such commonly used painkillers have caused such severe abuse of opioids in the U.S. and around the world. Whose fault is it? Pharmaceutical companies, doctors, or the FDA... The rise and fall of this Jewish wealthy family over more than half a century has impacted the whole of America and even the world.
