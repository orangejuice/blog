Dr. Wang just bought this book 'Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty', such a commonly used painkiller, causing such serious misuse of opiate drugs in the United States and even the world. Whose fault is it? The pharmaceutical company, the doctors, or the FDA... This wealthy Jewish family's rise and fall over more than half a century has affected the entire United States and even the world~
