  subtitle: Patrick Radden Keefe / 2021 / Doubleday
  intro: >-
    A grand, devastating portrait of three generations of the Sackler family,
    famed for their philanthropy, whose fortune was built by Valium and whose
    reputation was destroyed by OxyContin, by the prize-winning, bestselling
    author of Say Nothing


    The Sackler name adorns the walls of many storied institutions—Harvard, the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest
    families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the
    sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it
    emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a
    blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis.

    Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond,
    Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of
    the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric
    mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking
    research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing,
    especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.

    Arthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler
    fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be
    run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives,
    and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren
    grew up in luxury.

    Forty years later, Raymond’s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The
    template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium—co-opting doctors,
    influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug’s addictiveness—was employed to
    launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate
    some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health
    crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die.

    This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they
    would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of
    early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces of Greenwich,
    Connecticut, and Cap d’Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington,
    D.C.  Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers
    and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has
    used to evade accountability. The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife
    with drama—baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights
    in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom
    maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush
    the less powerful.

    Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing,
    exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the
    excesses of America’s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super
    elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to
    human suffering that built one of the world’s great fortunes.
