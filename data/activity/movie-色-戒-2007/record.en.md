On 2022-5-16, I watched the movie again with a friend. On 2021-2-2, I had a repeat viewing, this film can be called beautiful. Tang Wei's temperament and appearance is beyond reproach. She freely transitions between innocent student, actress within the film, and glamorous lady. Tony Leung is just like the actual spy leader. Secondary characters are rather simple and stereotype, but the main characters are so real, so passionate, one might forgive them. The historical setting adds depth to the melodrama, like a great tragic opera. In addition, the consistent style of the film from beginning to end, gives viewers much pleasure. Whether it is set decor or post-production, everything is meticulous, making people feel grounded. Last tagged on 2019-8-5.
