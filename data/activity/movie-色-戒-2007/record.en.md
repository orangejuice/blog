Rewatched with friends on 2022-5-16 / Rewatched on 2021-2-2, this work can truly be called beautiful. Tang Wei's demeanor and beauty are impeccable, effortlessly transitioning between a pure-hearted student, the 'play within a play', and the affluent wife. Tony Leung is really just like the spy leader himself. Secondary characters are somewhat thinly drawn, but the protagonists' renditions are so genuine and full of character that one could almost forgive them. Combined with the tragic historical backdrop, it's intoxicatingly bittersweet, a truly touching song of a wanderer. The film consistently maintains its style from beginning to end, making viewing pleasant. Everything from the set to post-production has been meticulously crafted, providing a very solid feel. / Last tagged on 2019-8-5
