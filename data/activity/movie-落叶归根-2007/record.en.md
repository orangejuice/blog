The film subtly integrates the background of the era, highlighting the realism and the insignificance and sorrow of human fate. I enjoy Uncle Benshan's performance. These simple-minded, marginal figures in society are brought to life, as if they have always been 'hidden' among us. The relentless pursuit of a promise is like the pilgrimage of the common people. Great works originate from life, but surpass it. It's both tragic and amusing, inciting heartache and helplessness.
