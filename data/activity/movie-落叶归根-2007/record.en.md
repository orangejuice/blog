The film even integrates the backdrop of the era, making it appear more authentic and highlighting the insignificance and pitiable nature of human fate. I enjoy Uncle Benshan's performance. These simple-minded societal fringe characters live on, almost as if they have always been 'hidden' among us. The continuous pursuit of a promise is like a pilgrimage for the common folk. A great work, stemming from life and surpassing it. Tragic yet laughable, heart-wrenching yet inevitable.
