Utterly persuaded and profoundly moved. Why is it so engaging, so expressive? Why do I, an outsider who doesn't belong to either black or white communities, find myself deeply entangled in its rich tapestry of emotional and moral complexities? The artistic portrayal of social issues made me envious because local cultural readers can fully enjoy the unravelling and analysis of inner conflicts and pain, watching and releasing them. The human care in their cultural society overflows. Moreover, this story goes beyond just the superficial issues of American racism. It's about love, equality, courage, resistance, freedom, fighting injustice, where the protagonist is both an observer and a participant, courageous, loving, powerful, not just following the crowd, keenly perceptive, seeking truth, faithful to oneself and the true facts, being oneself, unafraid of loneliness, exploring the edges of society. These values are eternally magnificent.
