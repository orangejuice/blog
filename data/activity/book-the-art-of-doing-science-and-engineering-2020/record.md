  title: The Art of Doing Science and Engineering
  subtitle: Richard W. Hamming Bret Victor / 2020 / Stripe Press
  intro: >-
    A groundbreaking treatise by one of the great mathematicians of our time,
    who argues that highly effective thinking can be learned.

    What spurs on and inspires a great idea? Can we train ourselves to think in
    a way that will enable world-changing understandings and insights to emerge?

    Richard Hamming said we can, and first inspired a generation of engineers,
    scientists, and researchers in 1986 with "You and Your Research," an
    electrifying sermon on why some scientists do great work, why most don't,
    why he did, and why you should, too. The Art of Doing Science and
    Engineering is the full expression of what "You and Your Research" outlined.
    It's a book about thinking; more specifically, a style of thinking by which
    great ideas are conceived.

    The book is filled with stories of great people performing mighty deeds--but
    they are not meant to simply be admired. Instead, they are to be aspired to,
    learned from, and surpassed. Hamming consistently returns to Shannon's
    information theory, Einstein's relativity, Grace Hopper's work on high-level
    programming, Kaiser's work on digital fillers, and his own error-correcting
    codes. He also recounts a number of his spectacular failures as clear
    examples of what to avoid.

    Originally published in 1996 and adapted from a course that Hamming taught
    at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, this edition includes an all-new
    foreword by designer, engineer, and founder of Dynamicland Bret Victor, and
    more than 70 redrawn graphs and charts.

    The Art of Doing Science and Engineering is a reminder that a childlike
    capacity for learning and creativity are accessible to everyone. Hamming was
    as much a teacher as a scientist, and having spent a lifetime forming and
    confirming a theory of great people, he prepares the next generation for
    even greater greatness.

Via tw Sand Mogican 翻了一下 「The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn」的开头，发现也是一本奇书。

Stripe Press的品味实在是不错。
