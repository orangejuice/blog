Via douban morgan I didn't expect to find something new about Wittgenstein again, it has been a while since I felt this after reading 'Genius as a Burden'. I admire his life, and now he seems more vivid. Private notes don't actually record any earth-shattering secrets, mostly just frequent mentions of sexual desires and complaints about people around him. The main concern for not publishing was probably that people felt his homosexuality might affect his academic status and reputation. Today, that seems unimportant.
