Via douban morgan, I didn't expect to read new stuff about Wittgenstein, haven't had this feeling for a long time after reading 'The Responsibility of Genius'. I admire his life, and now he seems to be more vivid. Personal notes actually don't record any earth-shattering secrets, just the frequent records of sexual desire and complaints about people around him, and the people who didn't allow it to be published probably thought more that the identity of homosexuality would affect the academic status and reputation, right? But today, this becomes unimportant.
