I've managed to watch 5 episodes. The plot is immature and the characterization shallow, there's no logical sense to it. It feels like a mixture of the sci-fi story of Ultraman fighting little monsters and crime psychology from Detective Conan. The use of explicit adult content was unsettling and reduced the overall quality. I also didn’t enjoy the rough and messy animation style and cheap, noisy special effects, whether with regards to the characters or the scenery. The only amusement lies in the quick and easy quantification and tracking of antisocial personality, but it ends just there. Other setting elements are full of mismatching and irrational feelings. The story built on this is shaky due to this foundation.
