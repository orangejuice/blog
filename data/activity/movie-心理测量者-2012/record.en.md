I watched 5 episodes and found the plot to be childish and the characters flimsy, with little logic to speak of. It's like a mix of superhero antics fighting minor monsters as in Ultraman combined with the psychological crime themes of Detective Conan. The series starts off with a liberal use of soft erotica, which drastically lowers the quality. I also dislike the rough and messy art style and the cheap, noisy special effects, whether it's the characters or the scenes. The only interesting aspect is the convenient quantification and tracking of anti-social personalities, but that's about it. The rest of the setting feels mismatched and illogical, making the world built upon it weak and slack.
