Via Twitter, a new Chinese book 'Thinking Makes Us Human' receives a four-star recommendation: The book focuses on our awareness of how others perceive us. It also critiques the expectation to achieve general artificial intelligence through machines. Mental development must be based on social interaction, involving emotional participation rather than a set of abstract, impractical deductions. Thought is inherently social, and both mind and thinking arise through social processes.
