Via the 'Successful People' Chinese new book, four-star recommendation: Thinking Makes Us Human. The awareness of how others perceive us is the main theme of this book. Meanwhile, the authors also critique the idea of realizing universal artificial intelligence through machines. A person's cognitive development must be rooted in social interaction, which involves emotional engagement, not a set of abstract, detached inferences. Thinking is inherently social. Mind and thought are produced through social processes.
