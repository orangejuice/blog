Via tw jess: There is a 'Sun Village' in the suburbs of Beijing, a place dedicated to receiving minor children of convicted people.

Before I left for abroad, I wanted to donate everything I had. I thought, if I was going to donate, I would donate it to them, to those children that the sun truly doesn't reach.

I couldn't get in touch. I asked a friend who works in the district government, she said, don't even think about it. That was in October 22 years ago, the city was closed off and there were meetings.

I hope they are still there.

They have a Danish documentary: 'Waiting for the Sun'.

In the film, there are two families, both with mothers who killed their fathers because of domestic violence.
