Via tw jess In the suburbs of Beijing, there's a place called Sun Village, specifically for the children of incarcerated individuals.

Before I went abroad, I intended to donate all my belongings. I thought if I were to donate, it should be to them, as they are truly the children who the sun doesn't shine on.

Couldn't get in touch. I asked a friend at the district government, and she told me not to think about it. That was in October 2022, during the lockdown + meetings.

I hope they are still there.

There's a Danish documentary about them: 'Waiting for the Sun'.

The film features two families, both where the mother killed the father due to domestic violence.
