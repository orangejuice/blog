The cream-faced actor’s whiny voice... recites lines with a furrowed brow and an irritating sibilant 's', making it unbearable to listen to, and he really shouldn’t have been in this plot; the watchability would likely increase without him. This also reveals the directorial pursuits, showing how fortunate the modern young men and women are, living in delicately designed sets, watching their idols indulge in role-playing. Watching the condensed 30-episode version is still drawn-out and diluted; I gave up after one and a half episodes. The street scenes and costumes are uniquely impressive, and the visuals are comfortably processed, which shows surface-level efforts; or, perhaps the props and post-production teams deserve some praise, but the core content is still lackluster. A rating over 8 does not reflect the general opinion, suggesting that many people are quite astute, despite the well-executed media campaign that still didn't tempt them to waste time watching it.
