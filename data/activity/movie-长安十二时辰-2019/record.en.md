The effeminate voice of this pretty boy actor... he rasps his lines with a frowned brow and his explosive 's' sounds are simply grating to the ears, making it unbearable to watch. He shouldn't be in this plot at all, the watchability of this show might significantly increase without him. This also shows what the production team is aiming for: how fortunate are the modern young boys and girls for the exquisite set design lets their idols freely role-play for them to see. I watched the 30-episode condensed version of the plot and it still dragged on and was filled with filler content, I gave up after one and a half episodes. The uniqueness in the design of the street scenes and costumes is notable, and the screen processing is very pleasing, the surface work is done very well. The props and post-production teams deserve some praise, but the same lacking substance remains. Ratings above 8 don't seem to be universal, it seems that many people are quite astute, even with all the good public relations work done, they did not waste their time watching.
