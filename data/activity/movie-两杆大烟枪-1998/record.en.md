Maybe because the subtitles were out of sync and I had to manually adjust them, I never really got into the plot. Or perhaps it didn't meet my expectations. When things seemed blurry, the story suddenly came to an end. Looking back, it's indeed a decent, laid-back dark comedy that meets basic standards. It's not exactly standout enough to be in the Top 50, though. Seems like I'm biased against comedies.
