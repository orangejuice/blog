Perhaps it was the unsynchronized subtitles that continuously needed manual adjustment, preventing me from getting into the story, or maybe it did not meet my expectations. When I was drowsy, the story abruptly ended. Looking back, it is indeed a decent, light-hearted noir comedy that meets standard expectations. It's not outstanding enough to be in the top 50 though. It seems like I have a bias against comedies.
