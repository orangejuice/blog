via Twitter, Tingyun: Yu Dafu was obsessed with male-female relationships throughout his life, but he was also educated by women. From 'Sinking' to 'The Lost Sheep', from 'An Evening Drunk with Spring Breeze', to 'She is a Fragile Woman'. These changing novel titles also witnessed the changes in Yu Dafu's inner life. His lucid and restrained period was after he fell in love and married Wang Yingxia. Those twelve years were the golden age of Yu Dafu's life. When he first started his romantic relationship with Wang Yingxia, Yu Dafu was still a boring middle-aged man mired in decadence, consuming opium, gambling, trying to hook up with a widow, and even routinely spending nights in brothels. As a writer, his private morals were not admirable. If one were to be harsh, he was almost despicable.
