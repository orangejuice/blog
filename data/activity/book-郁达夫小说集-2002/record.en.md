Via tw Stopping Cloud, Yutafu was obsessed with relationships between men and women all his life, but he was also educated by women. From 'Sinking' to 'Lost Lamb', from 'Intoxicated by Spring Evening', to 'She is a Weak Woman'. The changes in these story titles almost witnessed the changes in Yutafu's inner life. His clear and restrained time was the time after he fell in love with Wang Yingxia and got married. Those twelve years are the golden age of Yutafu's life. When he just established a romantic relationship with Wang Yingxia, Yutafu was a bored middle-aged man in decadence, smoking opium, gambling, trying to hook up with a widow, and even often spending the night in a brothel. As a writer, his personal morals were not good. If a bit harsh, he could be described as a 'scumbag'.
