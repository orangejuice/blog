  intro: >-
    In This Explains Everything, John Brockman, founder and publisher of
    Edge.org, asked experts in numerous fields and disciplines to come up with
    their favorite explanations for everyday occurrences. Why do we recognize
    patterns? Is there such a thing as positive stress? Are we genetically
    programmed to be in conflict with each other? Those are just some of the 150
    questions that the world's best scientific minds answer with elegant
    simplicity.

    With contributions from Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins, Nassim Taleb, Brian
    Eno, Steven Pinker, and more, everything is explained in fun, uncomplicated
    terms that make the most complex concepts easy to comprehend.
