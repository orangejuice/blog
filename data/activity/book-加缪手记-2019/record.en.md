Via Twitter user DouxiaoDou: As long as I keep reading, I can continue to understand my own suffering and counter my ignorance, narrow-mindedness, prejudices, and darkness. — Camus / Via Twitter user DouxiaoDou: Half of life is spent in hesitating to speak, turning away, and remaining silent. True life emerges from the tearing within. If you think life is beautiful and simple, you've never truly owned it.
