Via tw Douxiao Dou As long as I keep reading, I can always understand my own pain, always confront my own ignorance, narrow-mindedness, prejudice, and darkness. ——Camus / via tw Dou Xiao Dou Half of life is spent in withholding words, turning away, and being silent. True life appears when tearing internally. If you feel life is beautiful and simple, then you've never truly owned it.
