No wonder I can't get through this book, even though there are many feelings that seem familiar yet unfamiliar. Perhaps this kind of narcissistic confidence and the wild life unleashed in art is too far away from me, and can even be referred to as the opposite. Got to Chapter 6, for now, have put it aside.
