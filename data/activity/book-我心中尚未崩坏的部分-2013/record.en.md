No wonder I can’t continue with this book, even though there are quite a few seemingly incomprehensible but familiar feelings. It's probably because this kind of narcissistic confidence, soaked in literary art and wildly unleashed, is too far removed from me, even antagonistic. Got to chapter 6, then set it aside
