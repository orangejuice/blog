On a day at the start of 2022, I watched two videos, one is the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics, the other is a Chinese documentary 'Auntie'. The former is very fashionable and advanced perfect, the latter shocked me. An auntie from Anhui sells stir-fried rice and noodles on the streets of Shanghai at night. From the opening scene, I thought it was a small town, but later I found out it was in the Yangpu district according to the name of the community.
