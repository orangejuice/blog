Via Twitter Johnna: At the start of 2022, I watched two videos, one of the Beijing Winter Olympics opening ceremony and one Chinese documentary 'Auntie'. The former was very fashionable, advanced, and perfect; the latter shocked me. An auntie from Anhui, doing stir-fried rice and noodles, selling them on the streets of Shanghai at night. Initially, I thought the setting was in a minor eighteenth-tier county, but after searching by the community name, it turned out to be in Yangpu District.
