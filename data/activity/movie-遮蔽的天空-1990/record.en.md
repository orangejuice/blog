Via Twitter from Wesley: At the end of the movie, the original author, Paul Bowles, appears and slowly utters this passage: 
Because we do not know when death will come, we still regard life as an inexhaustible and endless source. Yet, the events that truly shape our lives might only happen a few times. How many more times will the childhood memories that once guided our lives come to mind? Perhaps four or five more times. How many more times will we witness the full moon rise? Maybe up to twenty times. But people always believe these opportunities will be endless. / via Twitter from Doudou: Those who realize the emptiness of life desire to live truly more than anyone else.
â€”Paul Bowles, 'The Sheltering Sky'
