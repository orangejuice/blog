In the end of the film, the original novel author Paul Bowles appears, slowly speaking these words: 'Because we do not know when we will die, we take life as an inexhaustible and endless source. However, things that happen in a lifetime may just happen so few times. How many more times can the childhood memories that have affected our lives emerge in our minds? Maybe four or five more times. How many more times can we witness the full moon rising? Maybe at most twenty times. But people always firmly believe that these opportunities will be endless.' / Those who realize the emptiness of life desire to live truly more than anyone else. - Paul Bowles, 'The Sheltering Sky'
