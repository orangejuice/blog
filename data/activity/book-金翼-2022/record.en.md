Via tw xdash This introduction to 'Golden Wings' is quite interesting, added it to my reading listâ€”

"This is a vibrant book that compiles the extensive experience of practices unique to China. It narrates the stories of two initially cooperative wealthy families from Fujian in the last century. Over 20 years, one family faced disintegration and destruction while the other flourished with many children and grandchildren through strategic collaborations, facing down threats like official bribery, bandit kidnappings, and military extortion that could have ruined them.

Most importantly, this book is a biographical study that records plentiful details, including the complicated power relations within the family's development and how these played a significant role in various scenarios."
