Via tw xdash, this introduction to 'Golden Wings' is intriguing; it has been included in the reading list——

'This is a vibrant reference book, encompassing the essence of China's unique practicable experiences.

It narrates the tale about two wealthy Fujian families from the last century who initially collaborated. Eventually, 20 years later, one ended up being unfortunate, with a broken family and lost fortune, while the other flourished with numerous children and grandchildren. The latter survived the challenges of official bribery, bandit kidnapping, military blackmail, and other series of risks that would shatter a family.

Most importantly, this book is a biographical work of humanity. It documents a myriad of details, as well as the intricacies of power relationships that formed during the family development process, and how they played significant roles in various scenarios.'
