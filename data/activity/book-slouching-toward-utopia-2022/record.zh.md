  title: Slouching Toward Utopia
  subtitle: J. Bradford DeLong 布拉德福德·德龙 / 2022 / Basic Books
  intro: >-
    From one of the world’s leading economists, a grand narrative of the century
    that made us richer than ever, yet left us unsatisfied

    Before 1870, humanity lived in dire poverty, with a slow crawl of invention
    offset by a growing population. Then came a great shift: invention sprinted
    forward, doubling our technological capabilities each generation and utterly
    transforming the economy again and again. Our ancestors would have presumed
    we would have used such powers to build utopia. But it was not so. When
    1870–2010 ended, the world instead saw global warming; economic depression,
    uncertainty, and inequality; and broad rejection of the status quo.


    Economist Brad DeLong's Slouching Towards Utopia tells the story of how this
    unprecedented explosionof material wealthoccurred,how it transformed the
    globe, andwhyitfailed to deliver us to utopia.Of remarkable breadth and
    ambition,itreveals the last century to have been lessa march of
    progressthana slouchin the right direction.
