There are many brilliant aspects to this historical read that broadens one's horizons, due to forward-thinking perspectives and engaging narration that compels one to keep reading. It is likely a must-read for beginners in history. Worth reading again, a must to re-read! When I am able to produce different interpretations and address the confusions within this book, I will have passed my history test.
