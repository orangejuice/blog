I found the movie conflicting. The contrast between the grand and weighty historical background and the overly simple and banal affairs of the heart; the tangible portrayal of Cixi and the surrounding child's play; caricaturish paper cut-out characters and complex real-life personalities. It perfectly illustrates the phrase 'old wine in new bottles'. The production is full of clich√©s and conservatism, and the script is drawn-out and verbose. Watching it at 1.5x or 2x speed doesn't feel abrupt. The grand changes in history are wrapped up in a soap opera-esque narrative which was infuriating to watch. I completed it owing to Cixi's superb performance and my interest in history. I give 3 points all to Yuko Tanaka. I lament that people are willing to watch such trivial dramas, and I criticize the narrow and immature level and environment of the production. Putting international actors together on the same stage for comparison is glaring. The core difference lies in whether one is able to understand history, empathize, and immerse themselves into the character. On the 29th of October, 2021, I saw the first episode and found it somewhat intriguing, so I continued watching it.
