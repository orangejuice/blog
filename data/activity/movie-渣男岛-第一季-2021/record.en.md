The show itself is directly a product of commercialization; its numerous labels are overwhelming to count. Eye-catching, consumerism, glitz, revelry, indulgence, insinuation, manipulation. The balance between rules and enjoyment is acceptable, which allows the reality show to go on, and under guidance, the true feelings of the participants are revealed, which also moved me. It's worth a watch. In terms of status, manipulation, security, strength, and weakness in male-female relationships, there are new insights and gains.
