Having reflected on this film for several days, it truly is a remarkable work that gathers numerous self-narratives of women, forming a tapestry of life's diversities. Initially, the imagery of a lone woman floating in the ocean broke through my defenses, instantly drawing me into the emotional depth of the film. The topics discussed in this film are so profound and expansive that they exceed my limited understanding; I dare not hazard a summary. In its essence, the film is filled with hope. Yet, it also leaves me wondering about the futureâ€”will it be bright? Will humanity still exist? Can humanity truly create a inclusive and harmonious utopia without leaving anyone behind? Will people then be experiencing despair and suffering? I cannot see into the future, nor find the answers.
