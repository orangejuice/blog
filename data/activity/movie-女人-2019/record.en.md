This is a great piece of work that I finished watching a few days ago. It collects the self-narration of many women, forming a portrait of various lives. At the beginning, the image of a woman floating lonely in the ocean breached my defenses, instantly striking an emotional chord with me. The spectrum of lives this film explores is so profound and wide that it surpasses my humble understanding, and I dare not to summarize it rashly. As for the existence of the film itself, it's filled with hope. But I wonder, what will the future be like? Will it be good? Will humanity still exist? Can humans truly build a harmonious global society that leaves no one behind? Will humans of that time feel despair and suffering? I won't live to see the future, nor can I find the answers.
