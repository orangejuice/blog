This movie is phenomenal, I'm at a loss for words to describe it. The era of Sampan Lord has passed, as has the era of telling his story. Will there come a day when people watch this movie and weep together in embrace? The HD version offers such flavorful visuals, making watching it a blissful experience. The Mandarin dub is a flaw, next time I'll definitely listen to the Cantonese version.
