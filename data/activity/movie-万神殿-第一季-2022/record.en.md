        Via tw V joy I must recommend this animated film. It's not an
        exaggeration to call it a masterpiece.


        Maddie is a girl who is bullied. One day she gets mysterious help online
        and she soon finds out that the helper was her recently deceased father,
        David.


        Each episode lasts 40 minutes, directly on par with live-action
        television dramas. The information is explosive, and the detailed
        foreshadowing is as numerous as cow's hair, if slightly careless, you'll
        lose track of the rhythm.

The film explores a possible scenario for the future, also an apocalyptic possibility, where people have mastered the technology to upload consciousness to digital media and maintain its continuity. I believe that it's feasible, and humans might one day be able to switch freely between digital and physical forms, with consciousness once born, never to die. However, such technology needs a corresponding philosophical ethics, and it takes even longer to establish philosophical ethics than technology, which is exactly where the danger lies. I like this kind of description of possible dangers. It brings a possibility to the public, and I believe that it must have promoted the situation in a better direction in the entanglement of intricate history. Public openness about AI technology research is just like smelling the fatal danger of not doing so. Humanity as a whole is like a beast in the jungle. You don't know if there are predators lurking, but you have to keep moving, looking for food, mates, and shelter. Every decision you make with unknown consequences determines your survival in the next second. Death is too simple, so simple that you just need to lie down and yell a few times, while life is like walking on thin ice, not to be treated lightly.
