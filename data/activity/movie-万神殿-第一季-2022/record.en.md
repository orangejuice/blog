        Via Tw V joy, I really must recommend this animated series. Calling it a
        divine drama isn't an exaggeration.


        Maddie is a girl who is bullied. One day, she receives mysterious help
        online, and soon discovers that the assistant is her recently deceased
        father, David.


        Each episode is 40 minutes long, directly comparable to live-action TV
        dramas. The show is packed with information, and the wealth of details
        and setups is enormous. You could easily lose track of the pace if
        you're not careful.

The film explores a future, and potentially an apocalyptic, possibility where people have mastered the technology to upload consciousness to digital media and maintain continuity of consciousness. I believe it is feasible, and even that one day humanity might freely switch between digital and physical states, where consciousness, once born, does not perish. However, such technology requires matching philosophical ethics, which take longer to build than technology itself, and this is precisely where the danger lies. I really like this depiction of potential danger, exposing a possibility to the public, which I believe amid the intricate entanglements of history, surely promotes the situation developing in a less harmful direction, just as today's open discussions about AI technology research reveal the lethal dangers of not doing so. Humanity as a whole is like a beast in the forest; you never know if a predator is lurking, but you must keep moving, looking for food, mates, and shelter. Any of your decisions with unknown consequences could determine your very survival the next second. Death is too simple, requiring just laying down, calling out a few times; life, however, is as delicate as skating on thin ice and must not be taken lightly.
