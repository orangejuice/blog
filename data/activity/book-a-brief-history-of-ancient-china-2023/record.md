  title: A Brief History of Ancient China
  subtitle: Edward L Shaughnessy / 2023 / Bloomsbury Publishing
  intro: >-
    A Brief History of Ancient China adapts a traditional Chinese historical
    format to present a multi-faceted account of the first two millennia of
    China's earliest history: from the time of the legendary rulers Yao and Shun
    (c. 2000 BCE) down to the end of the Qin dynasty (221-207 BCE).

    Organised into five major sections, it examines the political shifts of the
    major dynasties, the histories of local states, and the lives of key
    individuals. Drawing on analysis of textual and visual materials, and a
    variety of English and non-English sources, Edward L. Shaughnessy offers
    detailed insight into the contemporary religious and philosophical
    landscape, governmental and legal practices, and innovations in writing,
    literature, and music.

    Incorporating recent developments in the field, this book draws on
    archaeological discoveries from the last century, and examines the lives of
    central female figures, and other groups who are often underrepresented.
