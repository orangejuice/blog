        I've watched this Brad Pitt movie many times. Humans have seven deadly
        sins: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust.


        These are the underlying colors of human nature, and we spend our entire
        lives wrestling with them.


        When dealing with people, maintaining appropriate respect and applying
        pressure in moderation is the key to grasping human nature.

A powerful movie that left my heart turbulent and oppressed by dark clouds long after watching. The film has a tight structure, vivid characters, and a wonderfully suspenseful plot. However, the blend of human nature, religion, and philosophy behind it, expressed through meticulously designed cinematography, weighs so heavily that it leaves me breathless. This heaviness makes me feel as if I'm falling, as if the atoms in my body are losing gravity and about to disperse. Humans can be as great and beautiful as they can be evil and ugly. Human virtues and sins coexist and contrast each other; innocence cannot slip by unnoticed. Perhaps I'm getting old, as watching this movie left me panicked and confused, making me wish for a moment that I hadn't seen it. I wasn't always like this; I used to actively explore the darkness of human nature and be left in awe. Now, I no longer want to stand in the shadows, but only wish to face the sun, using my brief life to bask in incense and enjoy the warm sunlight. / Additional notes: 1. Reading the comments, I realized this feeling is called despair; 2. So the often-quoted "The world is a fine place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part" originates from here? 3. I love the old detective's attitude towards life.
