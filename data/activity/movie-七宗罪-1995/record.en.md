Via Twitter Hao Chen: The last line of the movie 'Se7en' that I'll remember for a lifetime says—"Hemingway once said, ‘The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.’ I agree with the second part..." / via Twitter Dr.Wang: Never trust people, trust human nature instead~ I've watched this Brad Pitt movie many times. Humans have seven sins: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. This is the fundamental color of human nature. Throughout our lives, we are actually playing games with it. In dealing with people, respect should be measured and pressure should be gauged to grasp human nature.
