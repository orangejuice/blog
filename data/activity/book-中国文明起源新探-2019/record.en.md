From Twitter Tianshu, reading Su Bingqi's 'New Explorations in the Origins of Chinese Civilization,' first article 'Two Vicious Circles,' first paragraph: For decades, there have been two vicious circles in our history education: one is the deep-rooted concept of a grand unified China, and the other is viewing the laws of social development proposed by Marx as history itself.// In fact, stepping out of these two circles is also like spitting out spoiled milk.
