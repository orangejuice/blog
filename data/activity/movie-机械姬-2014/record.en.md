The atmosphere is particularly bizarre. Artistic, eerie, thrilling, disaster, and lust are the labels for this film. The two artificial intelligences in the lab in the film are too strange, almost making it impossible for me to feel any goodwill. Moreover, such a project is far from the workload of one person, let alone something an isolated drinker with unstable mental health can achieve. Rather than calling it sci-fi, it's more of a thought experiment under many assumptions and established conditions. This unrealistic imagination makes the view and the credible space somewhat cramped.
