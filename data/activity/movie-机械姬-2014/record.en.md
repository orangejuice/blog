The atmosphere is particularly bizarre, marked by a highly stylized, eerie, thrilling, disastrous, and erotic tone. The two artificial intelligences in the laboratory displayed such peculiar behaviors in the film that they hardly garnered any sympathy from me. Moreover, such a project is clearly not a one-person job, let alone feasible by a reclusive, unstable alcoholic. Rather than a sci-fi, it's more of a mental exercise under many assumptions and set conditions. This kind of impractical imagination makes the scope and credibility somewhat cramped.
