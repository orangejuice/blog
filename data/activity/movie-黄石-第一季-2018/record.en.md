The American drama 'Yellowstone' is one of the few great shows I've watched in recent years. There's a conversation about fairness with a teenager that everyone should ponder: "Let me tell you what fair is. Fair means one side gets everything they want, and the other side can't complain. There is no such thing as fair in this world."
