Starting with the drawbacks, it is constrained, unconfident, and awkward in demeanor, lacking in public speaking skills, repetitive in content, and stiff in expressing viewpoints. Limited by language skills, the expression of ideas lacks persuasiveness. When filming abroad, one should familiarize with the script and revisit one's body language to show respect to the work and the audience. The voice-over, editing, and cinematography are major pluses; the young girl featured did an excellent job, even having her lines taken by the director on an escalator. The strengths lie in being like a mirror to me, vividly illustrating what my usual uncomfortable demeanor conveys to others, telling me that confidence and clear expression are paramount when facing the public. Not to criticize but still recommended for viewing, a trip to North Korea offers much food for thought. The director is bold and courageous, reflecting some youthful recklessness but lacking a humble, self-reflective attitude, looking forward to future improvements and better works.
