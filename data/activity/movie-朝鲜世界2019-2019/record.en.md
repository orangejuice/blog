First, the disadvantages; itâ€™s quite restrained, lacks confidence, and the demeanor is somewhat immature and timid. The ability to organize language is poor, content is repetitive, and the presentation of views is stiff. Due to the limited language organization ability, expression doesn't hit the mark, making the expression of views barely convincing. For field shoots, it's necessary to familiarize oneself more with sentences and review whether one's body language is satisfactory. It's also a manifestation of respect for the work and the audience. However, the narration, editing, and photography are excellent. The young girl featured did a great job, even upstaging the director on the subway escalator. The good aspect is that it's like holding a mirror to myself, allowing me to clearly understand what kind of impression my usually shy behavior leaves on others. It tells me that in facing the public, confidence and clear expression are paramount. The intent is not to criticize, and I still recommend watching it. A trip to North Korea can indeed provoke some thought. The director has the courage to think and act, showing some youthful impulsivity, but lacking a certain humble introspection. I look forward to improvements and better works in the future.
