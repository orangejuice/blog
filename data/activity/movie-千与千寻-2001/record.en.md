Family. Friendship. First Love. Loneliness. Responsibility. Solitude. Willfulness. Snobbishness. Value. Almost every element of a child's growth is included. How we wish that everyone could grow healthily with their friends in unique experiences, neither in seclusion nor under tyranny. Leaving lots of beautiful memories, farewell with smiles. Looking back, there is no regret, but nostalgia and anticipation for tomorrow.
