Family. Friendship. First Love. Loneliness. Responsibility. Solitude. Wilfulness. Snobbery. Values. Almost every element of a child's growth is included, isn't it? How wonderful it would be for everyone to grow up healthily with their peers through unique experiences, not secluded or under vile influence. To leave behind beautiful memories, to smile when waving goodbye, and to look back not with regret but with nostalgia and anticipation for tomorrow.
