Kate is just too pretty, I can't help but keep taking screenshots. The story isn't very moving, and the plot is quite ideal in a novelistic way, without being heavy. It offers a glimpse into the stark difference between modern cities and rural estates in the previous era when communication was not as developed, which is quite poignant. Still, it stands out as a rather good work, deserving of a bit higher than a 7.2 rating.
