Kate is too beautiful, can't help taking screenshots constantly. The story is not very moving, the plot is quite novel and ideal, not at all heavy. Gives a glimpse of the huge difference between modern cities and rural estates when communication was still undeveloped in the last era, which is also thought-provoking. Still a fairly good work, it could be rated a little higher than 7.2
