Mind blowing. It's hard to believe that there could be such a show, and here it is. As it progresses, it even makes me hold my breath wanting to know what will happen next, what will happen, and how it will be handled, inevitably making one reflect on how to be a team member. The show is very effective and the content is rich, documenting a corner of the era's entrepreneurs on the other side of the planet, enriching our awareness greatly. Glenn is very engaging, who wouldn't want to continue to work with him? A great team and leader, this show is just amazing.
