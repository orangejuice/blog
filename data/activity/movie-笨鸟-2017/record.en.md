The child actors' performances are commendable and they demonstrate a profound understanding of their characters. The subject matter is commendably good and it is tackled adeptly, but the storytelling is exceedingly poor. There are several excellent shots, but overall, the film lacks tension. Although the actors' performances are less showy, they are far from nuanced. This is an immature work. The producer seems to understand, but is unable to articulate it.
