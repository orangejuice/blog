The child actors' performances are really impressive, demonstrating profound understanding of the characters. The theme is very appealing, and the execution has some good points, but the storytelling is extremely poor. There are a few excellent shots, but the overall film lacks tension. Although the actors show less trace of acting, it is far from being dimensional. An immature work. The producer understands inside but fails to articulate.
