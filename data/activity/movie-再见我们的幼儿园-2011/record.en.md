Kanna is too adorable! This film seems to just center around this little protagonist, who is mature, sensible, and magnanimous. The child actors are really great, but the script could have been better. Not a single boy is not mischievous. After being mischievous, they run away without any character growth, and upon running, they don’t betray their friends. It’s a bit inexplicable. The plot advancement and emotional appeals are quite clunky, not a perfectly picturesque story.
