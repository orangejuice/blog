Little Kanna is too adorable! This film feels like it's constantly showcasing this young protagonist who is mature, understanding, and magnanimous. The young actors all perform brilliantly, although the script could be better. The boys are all mischievous, they run away without any growth, and even after running away, they don't betray their teammates. It's a bit inexplicable. The plot progression feels forced, as does the drama, it's not a perfect visual story.
