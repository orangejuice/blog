via Twitter by Tingyun: After reading the book 'Retrace', I was inspired to visit Changsha, Guiyang, and Kunming to see some of the old sites related to the National Southwestern Associated University. To witness the places where those historical events occurred. I'm particularly curious and nostalgic about that generation, nostalgic about the university's faculty and students defending academic freedom, respecting knowledge and education, and their idealism. Curious about how they understood and handled the crisis of the nation and self? In an uncertain era, what constitutes a good life? What is the relationship between thought and action? What is the meaning of life? Curious about what prompted them to make the choices they did regarding staying or leaving? And whether they regretted those choices later?
