via tw Stopping Clouds, after reading 'Re-treading', inspired to go to Changsha, Guiyang, Kunming, to see some of the old sites related to the Southwest United University, to see the sites of those historical events with my own eyes. For that generation, there are a lot of curiosities and nostalgia, remembering the defense of academic freedom by the teachers and students of the United University, remembering their respect for knowledge and education, remembering their idealism. Curious about how they understood and dealt with the crisis of the nation and themselves? What is a good life in uncertain times? What is the relationship between thoughts and actions? What is the meaning of life? Curious about what prompted them to make such choices between staying and leaving? And do they regret their original choices?
