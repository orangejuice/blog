Via Twitter, Ignatius Lee - The weak are not without their weapons. The view that excuses oneself as weak and therefore having no reason to resist is a deceitful form of modern cynicism: they willingly endure the tortures imposed by despotic societies while scoffing at and even harshly criticizing resistance. Though they may appear discontent, these individuals are slaves among slaves, and cynicism is the greatest barrier to social movements, constituting both a psychological and a social impediment. If a weak person truly has the resolve to resist, they will find various means of resistance, whether it is through non-compliance, non-cooperation, or boycotting in terms of reproduction, consumption, and policies, or by engaging in overcoming societal atomization through writing to boost the gradually waning morale, bringing together a fragmented society... There are many forms of resistance, but the question remains: are you truly resisting, or are you merely devising excuses to defend your enslaved state?
