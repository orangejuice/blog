Whether it's the plot progression, character conflicts, war scenes, or the tacky use of cinematic filters, must it all be so cliched and formulaic? Having finally finished the entire Harry Potter film series, I am profoundly disappointed in what is considered a phenomenal cultural phenomenon. I will concede that the Rowling magic world, centered around Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is an exceptionally well-constructed large-scale imaginative edifice. It aligns closely with humanity's understanding and curiosity of a magical world beyond our scientific experiences, using the journey from Platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross Station to Hogwarts as a way to fill a cultural void in human imagination, which explains its global popularity and irreplaceable status. However, beyond that, the storytelling and detail consistently stoop to banality and vulgarity, no better than a factory-produced, element-scrambling, nutritionless "thrill-read" that stands out only as a top-tier internet sensation.
