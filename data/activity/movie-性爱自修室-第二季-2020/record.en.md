Finished it in one day...A teenage story with a unique perspective and world. The theme is subtle, but according to the comments, everyone seems to accept it. Maybe, they all are those who have watched the first season. The story is well-narrated. It's about a group of youngsters, who through contrasting experiences, manage to shape their distinct selves, enriching the audience's worldview. It also contains some valid knowledge.
