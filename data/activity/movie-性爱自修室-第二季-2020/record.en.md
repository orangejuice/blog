Watched it all in one day...A wonderfully unique perspective and world in this teenage story. The themes are subtle, yet receiving almost universal acceptance based on reviews, perhaps from those who have seen the first season. The storytelling is good, portraying a group of youths experiencing the full stretch of their radically different selves, enriching the audience's worldview. It also includes some accurate knowledge.
