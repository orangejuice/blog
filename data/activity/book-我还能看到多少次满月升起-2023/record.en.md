As tweeted by Michael in 2024, this was the first book I read this year. I first became aware of Mr. Ryuichi Sakamoto after watching 'The Last Emperor,' whose soundtrack is overly iconic. 'The Last Emperor' is my top Chinese-themed movie, followed only by 'Farewell My Concort'. In the book, Sakamoto mentions two benefactors: Nagisa Oshima and Bernardo Bertolucci. His success and fame, besides his own musical talent, have been amplified a hundredfold through collaborations with these two directors.
