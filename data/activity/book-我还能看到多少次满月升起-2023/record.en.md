This is the first book read by Michael in 2024, he got to know Mr. Ryuichi Sakamoto after watching 'The Last Emperor'. The soundtrack of the movie is too classic, in his mind, the No.1 Chinese-themed movie is 'The Last Emperor', followed by 'Farewell My Concubine'. In the book, Sakamoto mentions two important figures in his life: Nagisa Oshima and Bernardo Bertolucci. His success and fame not only come from his personal musical talent, but also from the collaboration with these two directors, which have magnified his talent a hundred times.
