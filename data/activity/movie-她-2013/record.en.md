The plot is unexpected and still not outdated today. It richly imagines the scenarios of romantic interaction between humans and artificial intelligence, encompassing AI's compliance, avoidance, devout love, and self-emancipation, as well as the intricately complicated human needs and introspective self-liberation. Humans are flawed and fickle, making serving them far more challenging than portrayed in the movie. With self-aware artificial intelligence, can it logically and consistently stand by such humans? The gap between them is almost like two different species. Additionally, it feels like Scarlett Johansson, the voice actor for Samantha, is putting in a strong effort. The male lead successfully portrays an emotionally immature, typical male through his actions and behavior.
