The plot is unexpectedly good, and it still stands today. The film imaginatively explores a range of interactions between humans and AI in a romantic context. It depicts the AI's active obedience and distant evasion, its single-minded love and self-actualization, and the intricate and complex human needs, which ultimately lead to self-liberation. Humans are flawed and fickle, making serving them as challenging as depicted in the film. Can a self-conscious AI really stay logically consistent with such humans for long? The gap between them is so large it's almost as if they're two different species. Also, I always feel like Samantha's voice actor is working really hard. The male lead successfully portrays an emotionally immature and somewhat naive average man through his demeanor and actions.
