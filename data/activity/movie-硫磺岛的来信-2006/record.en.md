The scenes and production are too stingy, there are very few people on the screen, and there are not many tents. The digging of tunnels and caves is somewhat insincere - we see the same few people going back and forth in front of the camera, without the feel of a large-scale war. The male lead, always at the forefront, has a playful and adorable quality that seems constantly out of place. When the American forces arrive, the Pacific is full of ships. The extensive psychological portrayal leaves one feeling that something is missing - it's thin, one-sided, and verbose. The dialogue is detailed and calm, but lacks the tension of the battlefield and the stressed reactions to rapidly changing circumstances. Moreover, the volume of the sound keeps fluctuating, requiring constant adjustment. It is somewhat helpful for understanding the Battle of Iwo Jima, but lacks depth. Watching this film reminded me of 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk', which also focused on psychological portrayal, and it made me want to rewatch 'The Pacific War' and the portrayal of Iwo Jima.
