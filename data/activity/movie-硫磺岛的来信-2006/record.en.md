The scenes and production are too scanty; there are very few people on the screen, not many tents, and the digging of tunnels and caves seemed half-hearted. The same few people just move back and forth in front of the camera, which fails to convey the scale of army operations. The lead male character, with his delicate, mischievous, and naive demeanor, is always at the forefront. When the U.S. forces arrive, the Pacific seems to be packed with ships. Extensive psychological portrayals still seem to be lacking something, appearing both insubstantial and verbose. Delicate and composed dialogues feel off, missing the tension and the chaotic urgency of the battlefield. Moreover, the sound fluctuates greatly, necessitating constant adjustment of the volume. While somewhat useful for understanding the Battle of Iwo Jima, it lacks depth. Watching this film reminded me of another psychological portrayal in 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,' and made me want to revisit the Pacific War's Battle of Iwo Jima again.
