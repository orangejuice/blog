Sometimes there are scenes from the perspective of animals looking at the human world, which is incredibly heart-wrenching. Recently, having downloaded several films and TV shows, I just can't muster the enthusiasm to start watching them. Instead, I wallow in nature to numb myself. It's like a promotional video for equipment, a promotional film for Singapore.
