Via douban Jiang Nengjie / via tw Ting Yun. In 1911, the Qing Dynasty collapsed, marking the first time China fully opened its doors, coinciding with a period of turmoil in Western civilization: rampant nationalism, widespread utopianism, and even a very poor standard of artistic aesthetics. Hence, our timing to learn from the West was quite unfortunate. It means that when China truly 'opened its eyes to the world,' it encountered mainly two things that plunged Western civilization into crisis: nationalism and utopianism. The impact of these ideologies was profound and dominated the entire political scene in China throughout the 20th century. More than a hundred years have passed since the end of World War I, which produced three significant outcomes: liberal America, utopian Soviet Union, and nationalist Nazi Germany, setting the historical tone for the 20th century and continuing to influence today. A hundred years ago, Chinese sought to transform and learn from Western thought and civilization. Unfortunately, instead of embracing the flower of civilization, China grappled with the rubble from the ruins of Western civilization, finding itself mired in radicalism for a long time.
