Via Douban Jiang Nengjie / via TW Cloud pause In 1911, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown. For the first time, China completely opened its doors to the world. However, the Western civilization that China encountered was in turmoil: rampant nationalism, utopianism becoming prevalent, and even the standards of artistic appreciation were of low quality. Therefore, the timing of our learning from the West was unfortunate. In other words, when China truly 'opened its eyes to the world', what it mostly encountered were the two factors that led to the crisis of Western civilization: nationalism and utopianism. The influence of these two ideas is far-reaching. It can even be said that the politics of China in the entire 20th century were dominated by these two ideas. A hundred years have passed since the end of World War I. The three major outcomes of the war - liberalist USA, utopian USSR, and nationalist Nazi Germany - have laid down the tone for the 20th century and continue to influence the present. A hundred years ago, the Chinese began to awaken and started to learn about Western thoughts and civilization. However, unfortunately, China did not embrace the flower of civilization, but captured the fragmented remains on the ruins of Western civilization, and for a long time, fell into the mire of radicalism.
