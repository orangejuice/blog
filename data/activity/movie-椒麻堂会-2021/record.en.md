After watching 'The Meeting at Pepper and Szechuan Hall' through tw nfcloud, I was left in a state of nothingness. The film is an almost perfect combination of movie and Sichuan opera, with the director's unfettered imagination resulting in a surrealistic blend of reality and fantasy. Spanning over half a century, the movie presents a whirl of life's joys and sorrows as fleeting as smoke. Without a doubt, this film is one of the best Chinese-language films of the decade, with some even comparing it to 'Farewell My Concubine'. Regardless of whether it reaches greatness, 'The Meeting at Pepper and Szechuan Hall' is worth a watch. 9.5 out of 10.
