Watched 'Jiao Ma Tang Hui' via tw nfcloud and was left feeling completely void. The film combines Sichutan Opera and cinema nearly perfectly, showcasing the director's boundless imagination. Reality and fantasy intertwine in the most absurd and extraordinary ways. This 3-hour movie spans over half a century, depicting the changing tides of life and the myriad of human emotions, as ephemeral as clouds and smoke.

Undoubtedly one of the best Chinese-language films of the decade, some even compare it to 'Farewell My Concubine'. Whether it reaches the heights of greatness or not, 'Jiao' is definitely worth watching, 9.5
