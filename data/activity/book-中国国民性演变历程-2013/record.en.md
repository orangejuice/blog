It's an enjoyable read, quite comprehensive, outlining the development of national character from the perspective of the author. The content is quite enlightening, one of the most valuable books I've read. Those who dislike it are generally opposed to the viewpoints presented in the book, but the passionate text does not upset me, instead, I felt the author's way of thinking, values, and consideration. Not all books need to be written calmly and filled with evidences out of fear they can't convince. This book has its own value, should be rated above 8, but it's a pity that those who should read this book have no interest in it. If you're hesitating because of the low score, I still recommend you to give it a try.
