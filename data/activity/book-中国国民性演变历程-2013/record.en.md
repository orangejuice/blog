Very readable and quite comprehensive, it outlines the development of the national character as seen through the author's eyes. The content is very enlightening, making it one of the most valuable readings I have encountered. Those who despise it are mostly resistant to the forceful opinions presented in the book, but the passionate text does not make me dislike it; instead, it allows me to appreciate the author's way of thinking, value system, and contemplation. Not all books need to be written with calm and loaded with evidence for fear of failing to convince. This book has its value, deserving more than an 8 out of 10. Unfortunately, those who should read it show no interest at all. If you're hesitating because of low ratings, I still recommend giving it a try.
