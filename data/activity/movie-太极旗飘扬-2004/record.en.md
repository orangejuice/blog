The plot falls into clich√©, lacks plausibility, and overly dramatic portrayals, which affect the realism and immersion of the story. The battlefield set-up and effects are very good, and the cruelty is well depicted. A huge dilemma and the consequent helplessness loom large: who are we fighting for, and why? Watching them cheer when they heard the American troops were landing is somewhat poignant. It would have been great if their role was of the Chinese army.
