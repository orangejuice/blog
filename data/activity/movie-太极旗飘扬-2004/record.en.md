The plot falls into clich√©, lacking in plausibility and overly dramatized, which affects the realism and immersion of the story. The battlefield setup and effects are very well executed, showcasing brutality effectively. The overwhelming issues and resulting despair loom large, questioning why and for whom they fight. Watching them cheer at the news of US troops landing, there's a bittersweet sentiment, wondering how it would be if they were on the other side.
