Via tw roufu The essence of life is that a person should not have too many expectations of others. We always want to find someone who can share our pain and sorrow, but most of the time, our earth-shattering pain is nothing more than a dusty sweep in the eyes of others. Perhaps the loneliness of adults is self-sufficient in both joy and sorrow. ---"One Hundred Years of Solitude"
