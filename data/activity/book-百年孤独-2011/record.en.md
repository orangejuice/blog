Via the painful journey, the essence of life is that one should not have too many expectations of others. We always want to find someone who can share our pain and sorrow, but most of the time, our earth-shattering pains are just dust brushed aside in the eyes of others. Perhaps the loneliness of adulthood is to navigate the joys and sorrows alone.--- 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'
