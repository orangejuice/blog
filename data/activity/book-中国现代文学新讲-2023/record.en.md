Via Twitter, Tingyun. Teacher Qian Liqun said: "Every day of my writing of literary history is a day of re-engagement and debate with Lu Xun, Zhou Zuoren, Shen Congwen, Lao She, Ba Jin, Feng Zhi, Zhang Ailing, Xiao Hong... It's a conversation, discussion, and argument that is unprecedented in its closeness, nature, and urgency." Professor Sun Yu, who is also a researcher of modern Chinese literature, observes that the field is becoming increasingly ivory-towered, and it's rare to see a vivid contemporary consciousness. This contrasts sharply with the spiritual traditions of the subjects studied. Qian Liqun was one of the first to express concerns about this situation, believing that distancing from the 'May Fourth' spirit does not invigorate research. One way to access modern China is through modern literature. The edifice of literary history primarily relies on writers, especially major and classic writers; their principal value is reflected in their literary texts. Without the fundamental elements of writers and their works, there can be no talk of literary history. 'New Lectures on Modern Chinese Literature' is essentially a new compilation of modern Chinese literary history by Qian Liqun.
