Via tw Yunqi, Professor Qian Liqun said: "Every day of my writing in literary history is a fresh dialogue, discussion, and debate with Lu Xun, Zhou Zuoren, Shen Congwen, Lao She, Ba Jin, Feng Zhi, Zhang Ailing, Xiao Hong... It's a closeness, naturalness, and urgency that have never been seen before." In the view of Professor Sun Yu, who is also a researcher of Chinese modern literature, the study of Chinese modern literature has become increasingly ivory-towered, making it less likely to encounter fresh current consciousness. This is in stark contrast to the spiritual tradition of the research object. Qian Liqun was one of the first to express concern about this situation, believing that distance from the 'May Fourth' spirit will not bring vitality to the study. Opening up a way to modern China is to open up modern literature. The edifice of literary history is mainly supported by writers, especially major and classical writers; and the main value of a writer is his or her literary works. Without these two basic elements of writers and works, there is no literary history. The 'New Interpretation of Chinese Modern Literature' is essentially a 'Newly Compiled History of Chinese Modern Literature by Qian Liqun.'
