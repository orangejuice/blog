NHK's documentary once again opens up a parallel world. The story is quite romantic, struggling for dreams, and problems are overcome one by one. Unfortunately, without deep exploration of the theme, it appears like a beautiful fairy tale that doesn't stand up to scrutiny and lacks persuasiveness. Out of curiosity, I searched for the heroine Ji Fang after watching, and the resulting text was eye-opening. It's now difficult to rate. It's a pity that there isn't any blogger or YouTuber who represents this group. I'm very curious about their stories. Finally, it's astonishing to see Japan's continued observation of China's social development - they seem eager to understand us more than we ourselves do.
