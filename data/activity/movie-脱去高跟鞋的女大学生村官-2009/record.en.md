NHK's documentary once again opens up a parallel world. The story is romantic, fighting for dreams with problems being overcome one by one. The lack of in-depth exploration into this topic makes it resemble a beautiful fairy tale that doesn't stand up to scrutiny, looking unconvincing, which is a pity. Out of curiosity, I searched for the protagonist Ji Fang after watching, and the appearing texts were indeed surprising. It's impossible to rate this. Unfortunately, there's no blog or YouTuber for this group online; I would really like to know their stories. Lastly, the Japanese industry's sustained observation of China's social development is astonishing â€“ they seem more eager to understand us than we ourselves are.
