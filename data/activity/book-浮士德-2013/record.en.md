Via tw white light, among the works I've seen, I recommend the novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee and the short story collection 'Stories of Your Life' by Ted Chiang, George Orwell's '1984', and in the realm of poetic drama the ultimate deity: Goethe's 'Faust' along with Wagner's 'The Ring of the Nibelung'. I recommend in sociology the introductory comparative politics work 'The Concept of the State' by Professor Ruskin and the seminal work in communication science, 'The Peopleâ€™s Choice' by Lazarsfeld.
