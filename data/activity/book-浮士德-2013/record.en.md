via tw white light Among the works I have read, I recommend Harper Leeâ€™s 'To Kill a Mockingbird', Ted Chiang's short story collection 'Stories of Your Life', and Orwell's '1984'. For poetry, I recommend the only god in the opera: Goethe's 'Faust', and 'The Ring of the Nibelung'. Recommended sociological works are Professor Ruskin's introductory comparative political science work 'The Concept of the State' and Lazarsfeld's communication masterpiece 'The People's Choice'.
