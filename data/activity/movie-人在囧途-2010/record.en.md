A remarkably good comedy that touches on many aspects of social reality. It's warm-hearted, encouraging goodness, and Baoqiang's performance is on point. A film from 2010 that already has a sense of age. Went to watch it for some light-hearted stress relief and was not disappointed. Looking at it now, it can be regarded as a iconic film.
