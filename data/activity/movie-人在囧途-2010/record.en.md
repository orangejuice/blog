An excellent comedy that touches on many social realities, exuding warmth, promoting goodness, with an on-point performance by Baoqiang Wang. It's surprising that a film from 2010 already feels nostalgic. Watched it for some light-hearted stress relief, and it did not disappoint. It can now be considered a phenomenon.
