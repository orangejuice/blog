I read Shen Congwen's "Blooms and Vases" in the evening, in which there is an article talking about Jia Baoyu tasting tea at Rongcui Nunnery, the "split-left-right-gourd" flask Ban Pao Jia that Miaoyu gave to Baochai, and the Rhinoceros Horm Dipper she gave to Daiyu. Mr. Shen Congwen believes that Cao Xueqin is satirizing Miaoyu's affectation and falseness here. The "split-left-right-gourd" flask is a Shang Dynasty liquor container imitated by gourds, which puns the slang terms "class, pack, fake".
