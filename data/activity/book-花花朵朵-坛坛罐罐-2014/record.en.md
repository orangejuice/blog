Via Twitter Shengyi Wang: Reading Shen Congwen's "Blossoms Abound, Pots and Jars" this evening, there is an article discussing when Jia Baoyu tasted tea at Lingchui An. Miaoyu presented Baoyu's sister, Xue Baochai, with a 'left separated right melon' Ban Pao Jia, and to Lin Daiyu a Dian Xi Qiao.

Mr. Shen Congwen believes that Cao Xueqin was satirizing Miaoyu's affectation and falsehood here. The 'left separated right melon' Ban Pao is a gourd simulated Shang dynasty liquor vessel, phonetically resembling the slang 'fake packing.'
