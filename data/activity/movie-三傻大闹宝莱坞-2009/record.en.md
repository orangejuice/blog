2019-10-21 Another great movie hindered by its translated title. / 2024.2.2 Isn't it strange? An absurd and unrestrained comedy movie with heavy cultural attributes, yet, it achieves such completeness, touching and delicate, full of sunshine and affection, healing growth, and inspirational. It's very engaging, easy-going and moving. Thank you all for your wonderful performances.
