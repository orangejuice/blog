A distinct aesthetic quality pervades every scene, hinting at a sense of overwhelming oppression. The setting is gloomy and the unique lighting effects present a post-apocalyptic sense of wild order. The constant, subdued soundtrack provides an overarching rhythm to the film. The concept of virtual girlfriends conveys a subtle touch of the future. An interesting but somewhat irrational implementation. The threads on replicant technology involve not only genetic and consciousness editing ability but also suggest mechanical digital circuitry brain, which appears to be more plausible. The latter may be necessary for the former's technical problems to be resolved, of course, this point only became apparent after recent breakthroughs in large language models. Another notable point is that the experience of the movie feels like solving puzzles in a game adaptation, finding hidden clues and completing prearranged main tasks to unravel the mystery.
