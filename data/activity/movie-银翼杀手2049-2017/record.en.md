A unique aesthetic temperamentâ€”everywhere feels oppressively large, the climate is gloomy, and there's a distinctive use of lighting effects. It's set in a post-apocalyptic world with wild order and features a low, sweeping score throughout. The virtual girlfriend concept feels somewhat indescribable, indeed reflecting hints of the future, and though its realization is intriguing, there are some key irrational aspects. Moreover, the technoline of replicants, which includes but is not limited to genetic and consciousness editing capabilities, seems more realistically rooted in robotics and digital circuit brain technology; the former's technological challenges might even require the latter as a prerequisite for resolution. This only became apparent after recent breakthroughs in large language models. Additionally, the viewing experience resembles that of a game adaptation, with searching for clues to complete the main task arranged by the story line to solve puzzles.
