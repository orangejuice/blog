  title: The Great Divergence
  subtitle: Kenneth Pomeranz / 2001 / Princeton University Press
  intro: >-
    The Great Divergence brings new insight to one of the classic questions of
    history: Why did sustained industrial growth begin in Northwest Europe,
    despite surprising similarities between advanced areas of Europe and East
    Asia? As Ken Pomeranz shows, as recently as 1750, parallels between these
    two parts of the world were very high in life expectancy, consumption,
    product and factor markets, and the strategies of households. Perhaps most
    surprisingly, Pomeranz demonstrates that the Chinese and Japanese cores were
    no worse off ecologically than Western Europe. Core areas throughout the
    eighteenth-century Old World faced comparable local shortages of
    land-intensive products, shortages that were only partly resolved by trade.

    Pomeranz argues that Europe's nineteenth-century divergence from the Old
    World owes much to the fortunate location of coal, which substituted for
    timber. This made Europe's failure to use its land intensively much less of
    a problem, while allowing growth in energy-intensive industries. Another
    crucial difference that he notes has to do with trade. Fortuitous global
    conjunctures made the Americas a greater source of needed primary products
    for Europe than any Asian periphery. This allowed Northwest Europe to grow
    dramatically in population, specialize further in manufactures, and remove
    labor from the land, using increased imports rather than maximizing yields.
    Together, coal and the New World allowed Europe to grow along
    resource-intensive, labor-saving paths.

    Meanwhile, Asia hit a cul-de-sac. Although the East Asian hinterlands boomed
    after 1750, both in population and in manufacturing, this growth prevented
    these peripheral regions from exporting vital resources to the
    cloth-producing Yangzi Delta. As a result, growth in the core of East Asia's
    economy essentially stopped, and what growth did exist was forced along
    labor-intensive, resource-saving paths--paths Europe could have been forced
    down, too, had it not been for favorable resource stocks from underground
    and overseas.
