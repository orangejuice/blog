Although there are traces of performances, they couldn't resist the charm of the camera's language, script, and the actress. The powerlessness of personal fate, the challenges of being human, the greater challenges of being a woman, the stunning beauty of love, the sorrow of love, and the dramatic conflicts that tear at the heart. It's heartbreaking and tear-jerking. Pure, honest, adorable, beautiful, hopeful, and lively women aren't just symbols, but represent expectations in everyone's hearts towards themselves, life, and meaning.
