There are traces of acting, but the language of the camera, the screenplay, and the charm of the actress are overwhelmingly compelling. The powerlessness of personal fate, the difficulty of being human, especially being a woman, the sublime beauty of love, the sorrowful tragedy of love, the conflicts are both dramatic and heart-wrenching. It is truly tear-inducing and heartbreaking. The innocent, genuine, lovely, beautiful woman full of hope and vitality is not merely a symbol, but represents everyoneâ€™s aspirations for themselves, life, and meaning.
