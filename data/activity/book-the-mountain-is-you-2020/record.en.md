Via tw indigo - Don't always think that you have to do it well, just do it; don't think too much about whether you want to do it or not, just start doing it;

- The motives hidden in your subconscious are essentially what you desire the most;

- You don't need to wait for the day when it 'feels right' to begin changing, you just need to change a little at a time, and then let the energy gradually accumulate;

- Unlike physical healing, after emotional healing, you will not return to your previous state, you will transform into a completely new person;

- To be reborn, you must give up! You need to give up your comfort zone and sense of direction, abandon your current friends and relationships, give up the idea of being liked and understood; the cost of rebirth is giving up your current life.

In the end, what you must truly surpass is not the mountain, but yourself!
