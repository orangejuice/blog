Via tw indigo - Don't always feel the need to do things perfectly; doing them is enough; don't think too much about 'want or not to do', just start doing it;

- The motivations hidden in your subconscious are basically what you most desire;

- You don't need to wait until the day 'feels right' to start changing, what you need is to change a little bit at a time and let energy accumulate gradually;

- Unlike physical healing, after emotional healing, you won't return to your previous state, you will transform into a new person;

- Quitting gives you a new life! You need to give up your comfort zone and sense of direction, abandon your current friends and relationships, give up the thought of being liked and understood; the cost of a new life is to give up your current life.

In the end, what you must succeed in overcoming is not the mountain, but yourself!
