  title: The Mountain Is You
  subtitle: Brianna Wiest / 2020 / Thought Catalog Books
  intro: >-
    This book is about self-sabotage.

    Why we do it, when we do it, and how to stop doing it—for good.

    Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is
    why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile.
    But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building
    emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies,
    releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our
    highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our
    potential.

    For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big
    challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To
    scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of
    excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the
    climb.

    In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves.

Via tw indigo - 别总想着必须要干得漂亮，干就是了；别想那么多“愿不愿做”，先做起来再说；

- 隐藏在潜意识中的动机基本上就是你最渴望的东西；

- 你无需等到“感觉对了”的那一天才开始改变，你需要的只是一次改变一点点，然后让能量逐渐累积；

- 与身体疗愈不同的是，内心疗愈之后，你不会回到之前的状态，你会蜕变成一个全新的人；

- 放弃才会获得新生！你需要放弃你的舒适区和方向感、弃你现有的朋友和关系、放弃被喜欢和理解的念想；获得新生的代价是放弃你现有的生活。

说到底，你必须要成功超越的，不是大山，而是你自己！
