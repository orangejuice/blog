It’s hard to read, honestly. For a work and title as well-known as this, it’s quite different from what one might expect. Despite the philosophical discussions it's reputed to contain, it’s not light reading—at least not even moderately so. Getting enjoyment out of reading it might not be something a novice can achieve. Perhaps it might be better to revisit it later.
