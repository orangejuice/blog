It's a difficult read, to be honest. This famous work and its title are quite different from what one might imagine. Even though, as many people say, it's full of philosophical discussions, it isn't an easy readâ€”perhaps not even a moderate one. Gaining pleasure from reading it may not be something a newbie can accomplish. Maybe it would be better to revisit it in the future.
