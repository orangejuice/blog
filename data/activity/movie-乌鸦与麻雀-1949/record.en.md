Truly superb performances, an exceptionally good work. It made me so gripped, weeping bitterly, questioning why such suffering, such oppression, such darkness, such hopelessness. The ending is incomplete yet doesn't seem so, a work crafted with heart and effort. The actors, undoubtedly infusing their own experiences and beliefs, must have enjoyed the hard-fought happiness on New Year's Eve, while also projecting their hopes and aspirations for the new society. But what does this longing bring about? Ah, this suffocation, leaving no place to hide.
