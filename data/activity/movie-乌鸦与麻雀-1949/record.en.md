Truly an excellent performance, a remarkably good work. Watching it made my heart ache, I sobbed uncontrollably. Why is it so bitter, so oppressive, so dark, so hopeless? It has a lousy ending, but it doesn't seem like one. It's a work that was made with great effort and heart. The actors must have used their own experiences and beliefs, indulging in the hard-earned happiness on New Year's Eve, also projecting their expectations and aspirations for the new society. But what is this aspiration waiting for? Ah, this suffocation leaves no place to hide.
