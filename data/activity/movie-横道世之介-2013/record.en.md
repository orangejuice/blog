How can I put it? It's probably a fantastic comedy that satisfies a longing. Although the actors' dialogues and actions are exaggerated, it doesn't obstruct the characters from being perfectly adorable. The couple's love is so sweet, it literally melts away. The excited shouts of 'Yonosuke' captivate the heart, making me laugh and cry as I clutch my beer, sipping it one gulp after another. Purely optimistic, positive, and bright, it's a simple beauty yet an unattainable dream. The abrupt ending infuriated me, as I wished to keep watching this sweet love without diverting my eyes.
