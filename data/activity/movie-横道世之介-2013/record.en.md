In a word, it's probably an exciting comedy that can satisfy people's desires. Though the dialogue and actions of the actors are a bit exaggerated, it doesn’t hide that the characters are endearing and lovable. The sweet love between the two is beyond sweet, melting into each drop of a trickle. The exciting screams of 'Sideways' seizes one’s soul, causing me to both laugh and cry, swigging beer mouthful after mouthful. Its simplicity, optimism, positivity, and brightness represent an easy beauty, yet a distant dream. The abrupt end is breath-taking. I want to see this sweet love and can't turn my eyes away.
