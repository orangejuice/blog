It wrenches my heart to keep watching, and just when I hope to learn more, it abruptly ends. The children interviewed are so much more mature than I was at their age, and their expressiveness is far stronger. They could have outperformed me in countless ways, yet the harsh reality is that while my life is in chaos, theirs is even more so, as they stare into the abyss. What's remarkable about this film is its rarity. Amidst this land teeming with humanity, so prosperous, yet there is rare willingness to turn the lens onto the people themselves. The spotlight—or even just a supporting role—is hardly ever given to the marginalized community of 600 million people with a monthly income of less than a thousand yuan. It seems reality is still rather distant to us. We can only find a bit of comfort in the few works that depict it.
