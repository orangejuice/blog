It's unclear why Michael couldn't offer Hannah more tenderness in the end. From the story told in the film, Hannah, who is illiterate and straightforward without much thought for the welfare or morals of humanity, is not a major player even in the persecution she is involved in. As a small figure, she didn't do anything wrong; she took her jobs seriously, whether as a guard or a ticket seller. Her jobs also caused her harm, leaving deep psychological scars. Despite loving her deeply, giving her life purpose and hope, ultimately taking away her hope could be seen as a form of murder. I find it extremely cruel. Humanity is incredibly fragile; learning from past mistakes seems impossible. Even today, this major historical event remains unclear, with no consensus or critical theory established. Modern education, riding the coattails of modernity, seems cheap and primitive. If such incidents were to occur today, guards might still be clueless about what to do best. A cunning, guilty person might still manage to talk their way out of trouble, while a simple, innocent person could end up suffering immense blame and emotional pain. Whose fairness does the law maintain? Those who are eloquent and shrewd?
