I am not sure why Michael couldn't be a little more tender to Hanna at the end. According to the story in the film, Hanna is illiterate and simple-minded, not thinking too much about the welfare or morality of all humanity. Even during the persecution, she didn't play a key role in making any decisive decisions. As a small person, she didn't do anything wrong. She was diligent in her work, regardless of whether she was a guard or a ticket seller. The work also caused her harm and buried a tremendous mental shadow in her heart. He clearly loved her very much, gave her life goals and hope, but in the end, he destroyed her hope again. Isn't that murder? It feels too cruel to watch. Humans are indeed very weak, and it is impossible to learn lessons. The discussions about this great historic event is still unclear. A consensus and dialectical theory cannot be established. Modern education is simply a primitive and cheap shroud. Suppose such a thing happens again now, the guard might still not know what to do in such a situation. A clever and guilty person can still do bad things and escape slickly, while an innocent and simple person is blamed and suffers soulful agony. Whose fairness does the law maintain? For the sophisticated and eloquent people?
