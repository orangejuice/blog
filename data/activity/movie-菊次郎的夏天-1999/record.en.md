A long, sweltering, pure yet hazy summer vacation, and the innocent dreams unique to children. Reality and dreams are blurred in memory, where men appear foolish yet endearing and gentle, and women are as beautiful as celestial beings. The reason why these memories are so wonderful lies in the love one can feel from every individual.
