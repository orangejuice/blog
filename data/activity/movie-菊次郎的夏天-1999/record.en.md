A long, sweltering, pure and hazy summer vacation, and the kind of tender dreams unique to children. Reality and dreams blur together in memory, where men always seem foolish yet endearingly gentle, and women appear as beautiful as celestial beings. From everyone, there emanates a feeling of self-love, and that is precisely why these memories are so beautiful.
