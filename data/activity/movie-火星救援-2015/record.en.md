The pacing of this film is really great, with scenes and camera language contracting freely, gently advancing, accumulating emotions, and then exploding intensely at just the right moment. The skillful and mature techniques are truly astonishing. It's been a long time since I've seen a film so exhilarating, so realistic, and so human-friendly with intelligence on point. The primal desire and instinct for human survival and mutual aid couldn't be more direct and touching. The consistently full-on American humor throughout doesn't feel contrived at all; instead, it highlights seriousness and tenacity, respect and understanding of others, and irreplaceably lubricates teamwork, making any dry and serious matter light and interesting. How could such values not attract people from all walks of life?
