This film is skillfully produced and re-enacts many highlight scenes of the imperial palace. It does a structured though incomplete setup for the impending demise of the grand edifice. The only self-reflection in the film is about the incompetence of the late Qing dynasty royal family. Why limit the scope to this? Are other important events or stages in the life of Yuanmingyuan forgotten? Why did the allied forces burn down Yuanmingyuan? What about the looting and arson that even the commoners, high officials, and the royal family participated in, or the selling of rocks and timber? The garden's current state is far different than how it was in 1860 after the fire. The audience is left only with resentment toward the incompetent late Qing emperor and stereotypical impressions of foreign bandits. Is the production satisfied with that? The production quality is quite good, but the retrospective of this historical event still has plenty of room for detail and reflection. This simplified narrative with a nationalist perspective filled with prejudice is not satisfactory. Looking forward to better productions.
