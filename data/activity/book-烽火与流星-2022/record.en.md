Via Twitter, 'Old Youth' shared today, after finishing this book by Tian Xiaofei, one can't help but admire Tian’s excellent writing. This book offers a very good reading experience as an academic work, filled with the heaviness of history in literary research. The ruins of the Xiao-Liang mountains leave behind a rich cultural heritage, and the fall of the Southern Dynasties heralds the pinnacle of medieval Chinese literature — the precursor to the Tang and Song eras. "War and destruction are transient, but the flame of poetry is everlasting."
