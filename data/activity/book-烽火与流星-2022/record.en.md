Via tw Old Youth, I finished reading this work by Tian Xiaofei today, and I can't help but admire Tian's excellent writing. This book is a highly enjoyable academic work to read, where its literary research is brimming with the weightiness of history. The collapse of the Xiao and Liang mountains has left behind a rich cultural heritage, and the fall of the Southern Dynasties is the precursor to the peak of medieval Chinese literature - the Tang and Song Dynasties. 'War and destruction are short-lived, but the flames of poetry live forever.'
