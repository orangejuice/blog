Via tg Hardcore Pawn / via tw Domo Desperate souls irredeemably wander into live shopping broadcasts. Unfortunately, this is a desolate and numb era, thus the broadcasts are packed... The consumerism of today holds as much power for humanity as religion did in the Middle Ages. It's coated with a layer of sweetness, and apart from the colorful sensory stimulation, it's fundamentally no different from any other religion. Its doctrine is brutally simple: pursue wealth, then squander it. In the utopia depicted by British writer Aldous Huxley, people in the civilized world suckle at the honeyed teat of entertainment-driven consumerism, greedily consuming brand new clothes, expensive events, and delightful experiences. They know nothing of love and commitment, indulging day and night in the ephemeral joys, trying to fill the inexplicable yet unshakable void and loneliness within.
