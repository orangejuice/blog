Via tg Hardcore Rookie / via tw domo, the mentally devastated have hopelessly walked into the live streaming shopping channel, unfortunately, this is a time of mental desolation, numb and depressed, so the live streaming room is full ... 

Consumerism to modern humans is as mighty as religion was in the Middle Ages. It's coated with a sweet layer, apart from the colorful sensory stimulation, its essence is no different from any other religion. Its doctrine is simple and rough, with only this one: pursue wealth and then squander it. 

In the utopia depicted by British writer Huxley, people in the civilized world are like dense black holes, desperately sucking consumerism, the honey of entertainment, greedily consuming new clothes, expensive entertainment activities, and the pleasure of slack. People know nothing about love and commitment, they are just indulging in pleasurable illusions day and night, trying to fill the ununderstandable but inseparable emptiness and loneliness in their hearts.
