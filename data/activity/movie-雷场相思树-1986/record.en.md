Via Twitter user DingDing: In the old mountain front lines, the story of five college graduates experiencing life and death tests during the war. Douban review: At that time, the portrayed Chinese soldiers were wise and brave, tangible and real, able to smoke and dance, with love and hatred vividly etched on each youthful, naive face. While not the pinnacle of its genre at the time, it could be considered the common man's version of 'A Wreath Under the Mountain'. The film focuses more on the brutality of combat and the ideological transformations of soldiers facing such harshness.
