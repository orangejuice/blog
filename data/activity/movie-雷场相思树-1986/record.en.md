The story depicts the survival tests endured by five university graduates on the Laoshan front line during war. The film portrays Chinese soldiers of that era as intelligent, brave, and human with emotions, capable of smoking and dancing. Their love and resentment is etched on their youthful faces. Although not top-notch in its genre, it can still be considered a populace version of 'Rings under the High Mountain'. The focus of the film leans more towards showing the cruelty of battles and the mentality changes of soldiers in the face of brutal warfare.
