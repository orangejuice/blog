A great introductory book on the current forefront of scientific development (written in 1998) that explains the world's appearance. While it's termed 'introductory,' for someone like me with virtually no scientific literacy, it's still quite challenging. I read it intermittently and even skipped some parts. The author's narrative ability and the depth of his sweeping arguments really evoke envy and admiration. I'm impressed by his scientific literacy, attitude, and clear rational worldviewâ€”double the admiration and respect. The translation is also superb. I will need to revisit it after some time.
