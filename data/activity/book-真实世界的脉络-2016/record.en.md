A fantastic basic introduction to the frontiers of current scientific development (published in 1998) and its explanation of the world. Although it's a basic introduction, it was still challenging for someone like me with virtually no scientific literacy. It took me a long time to read it in pieces, and I had to skip around. The author's ability to tell a narrative story with such depth is truly admirable, as well as his scientific literacy, scientific attitude, and clear rational worldview. I twice admire it. The translation is also great. I'll need to read it again after some time.
