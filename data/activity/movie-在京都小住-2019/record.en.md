The plot is somewhat unexpected and different from what I imagined. When the details of the shopkeeper preparing food were captured, it revealed that things were not as simple. The gentleness flows and heals the heart. The old man's stubbornness and impressive acting, the female lead's sunny cuteness, slowed my heartbeat on this gloomy afternoon. Seeing the good and the bad in Japan, for some reason, it always makes me think of my own country, think of the past, think of the present, think of the future.
