The plot was a bit unexpected and different from what I imagined. When it focuses on the meticulous details of food preparation by the restaurateurs, you realize things are not so simple. With gentle flow, it soothes the heart. The grandfather's stubborn expertise and remarkable performance, alongside the sunny and adorable female lead, slowed my heart rate on this gloomy afternoon. Seeing the good and the bad of Japan somehow always makes me think of my own country, reflecting on the past, present, and future.
