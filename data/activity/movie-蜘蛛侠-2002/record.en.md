After hearing about Tobey's life story from Lao Gao, I couldn't resist giving Spider-Man, which I previously felt indifferent about, a chance. It's a quintessentially Marvel-style thrilling film, where the superhero is both idealistic and kind, bearing the fate of all humanity but remains confident and modest in front of the girl he loves, protecting and accompanying her. From Sun Wukong to Spider-Man, and even the most mystical Doraemon, these are probably the childhood dreams of a generation.
