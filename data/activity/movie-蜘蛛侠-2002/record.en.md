After watching Laogao's introduction to Tobey's life experience, I couldn't help but watch Spider-Man, which I had always been indifferent to. It is a refreshing Marvel-style movie. The superpowered character is ideal and good-hearted, carrying the fate of all mankind, but is confident and low-key in front of his beloved girl, protecting and accompanying her. From Sun Wukong (Monkey King) to Spider-Man, as well as the most magical Doraemon, these are probably the childhood dreams of a generation.
