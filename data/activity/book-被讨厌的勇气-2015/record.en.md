      comment: In my opinion, it does not greatly contradict the theory of an original
        family. It is these varying perspectives that generate excitement. All
        these are valuable viewpoints. The ability of mankind to possess such an
        insightful vision makes one proud. It presents hope that the future
        might not be as bleak. However, in the modern world, these experiences
        are still quite rare and it's fortunate for those who have them. Books
        are lovely! The earlier one starts reading, the sooner a vast and
        enriching reading system is established. One's life will then become
        more substantial, significant and natural, making happiness achievable
        effortlessly. 'It depends on how one views it' does not entail
        nitpicking the past, but merely stating a fact to assist in your future.

      comment: Via tw Lao Bai, I read this book a few years ago, at which point, I was
        at an all-time low. I had an irresolute personality, could not dare to
        refuse others' irrational demands, and had severe social anxiety. I was
        afraid to walk alone in the campus and spent all day hiding in my room,
        constantly on my phone. I felt like a complete wreck, with no hopes for
        life, until I found this book. I read it like grasping at straws for
        survival, going through it word by word. It took me five days to finish
        reading, and at the end of it, I felt like I had been set free from a
        cage. It was like a breath of fresh air! I felt I could do anything I
        wanted, could communicate easily with others, dine alone or attend class
        comfortably, shop in malls on my own, or go to the cinema to watch
        movies. Everything seemed to be brighter. This book teaches you to
        separate the self from others, break the limitations you have put on
        your own mind, let your natural self out, and make your life simpler and
        free.

Through tw Lao Bai, I read this book a few years ago, at which point, I was in a dreadful condition. I had a weak-willed personality, not daring to turn down other's unreasonable demands. Additionally, my crippling social anxiety prevented me from walking alone on campus, confining me to my room, constantly affixed to my cellphone. The intensity of my distress made me feel worthless, as life seemed utterly hopeless. However, this book came as a beacon of support. I would read each word carefully, encompassing five entire days. Once done, it felt as though I had been freed from a cage. The book teaches one to differentiate the self from others, breaking the mental confinements you've set upon yourself and unleashing your true nature. The journey of life would then become simpler and more liberated. / via tw Huangpu Memory, you are not living to satisfy other's expectations, and likewise, they are not there to fulfil yours. You must not fear the gaze of others nor require their approval. Go on to choose the path that you deem fitting. This essentially means, neither should we interfere in another's affairs, nor let them intrude ours.
