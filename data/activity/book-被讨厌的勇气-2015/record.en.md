      comment: In my view, this doesn't necessarily contradict the theories about
        native families; it's these different perspectives that are exciting.
        All are valuable viewpoints, and it's a proud thing for humanity to have
        this kind of insight, seeing a hopefully less dismal future. But in
        modern times, these experiences are still rare, lucky to have them.
        Books are wonderful! The earlier you start reading, the more
        comprehensive and rich your reading system will be, making life fuller,
        more meaningful, and naturally easier to enjoy happiness. 'It depends on
        how you see it,' isn't about criticizing the past, but just informing
        you of a fact that may help your future.

Via tw, Old Bai: I read this book several years ago when I was in terrible shapeâ€”weak personality, afraid to reject unreasonable demands from others, and also suffering from severe social anxiety. I couldn't even walk alone in campus; I would just stay in my room all day, lying on the bed playing with my phone. I felt completely useless, life seemed hopeless, until I found this book. I clung to it desperately, reading every word. After five days, when I finished, I felt like I had been freed from a cage. This book teaches you how to separate self from others, to break the mental cages you set for yourself, and to unleash your true nature. From that point on, life becomes simpler and freer. / Via tw, Huangpu Memories: You are not living to meet others' expectations, nor are they living to meet yours. Don't be afraid of others' gazes, nor seek their approval vehemently. Just choose the path you think is best. This means neither interfering in others' affairs, nor letting them interfere in yours.
