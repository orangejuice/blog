Via Twitter, Old Cat Xu describes how this genius found the secret to beating the casino half a century ago. He then adeptly applied the same techniques to the financial markets, achieving world-class returns. "Beating All Markets" is Thorp's autobiography, published in Chinese in 2019. This legendary genius shares his adventurous journey through casinos and the stock market, revealing secrets to outsmarting the dealer and beating the markets. For instance, focusing on the cards '5' and 'A' can decide the game of Blackjack; investment strategies such as the 'Kelly criterion,' 'scientific prediction,' and 'price anchoring' are keys to conquering the markets. Ultimately, Thorp also summarizes life's success formulas through his legendary experiences:
- One needs strong self-learning and independent thinking capabilities;
- Understanding of basic financial and economic knowledge;
- Clear understanding of risks/rewards and uncertainties in investments and life;
This enables you to beat most people and become a winner in life.
