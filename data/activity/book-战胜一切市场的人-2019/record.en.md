According to tweeter Xu Laomao, this genius found the secret to beating casinos half a century ago. He also ingeniously applied the same tactics to financial markets, yielding world-class returns. 'The Man Who Beat the Markets' is Thorp's autobiography, with a Chinese version published in 2019. This legendary genius shares his adventures in casinos and stock markets, unveiling the secrets to beating the dealer and markets. For instance, by focusing on the '5' and 'A' cards, one can win at blackjack; the 'Kelly Criterion', 'scientific prediction', and 'price anchoring' are his investment strategies for conquering the markets. In the end, Thorp also uses his legendary experiences to deduce the laws of success in life: 1. You need to be capable of self-learning and independent thinking; 2. You should have some comprehension of basic financial and economic knowledge; 3. You should clearly understand the risks/returns and uncertainties in investment and life. With these, you can outperform most people and become a winner in life.
