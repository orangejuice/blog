Via Twitter's mindforge: 'Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity' has been published in Chinese, titled 'Beyond a Century', with a Douban score of 9.2. Why does your annual physical show 'normal' blood tests and cholesterol levels yet you may still be unhealthy? Why is exercise the most powerful longevity 'drug', and how do you start training for the 'Centenarian Decathlon'? Why should you forget 'dieting' and focus instead on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your diet? Why focusing solely on physical health and longevity while neglecting emotional health may bring ultimate disaster?
