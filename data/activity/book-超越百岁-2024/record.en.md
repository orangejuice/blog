Via tw mindforge Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity now has a Chinese version, titled 'Beyond a Century', scoring 9.2 on Douban. Why, despite your blood test and cholesterol results showing 'normal' in annual check-ups, you may still be unhealthy. Why exercise is the most effective 'medicine' for longevity, and how to start training for 'decathlon capabilities at 100 years old'? Why you should forget 'dieting' and instead focus on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating habits? Why merely pursuing physical health and longevity while neglecting emotional health might lead to ultimate disaster?
