Via tw Xu Chonglang, I just finished the last episode of the seventh season of 'Billions' yesterday, with many feelings. Throughout the show, the attention is basically focused on three people, Bobby, Prince, and Chuck. 'Billions' seems to be a pursuit of money, and tells the story of Wall Street hedge funds, but the ultimate goal is power.
