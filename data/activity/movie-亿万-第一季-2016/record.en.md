Via Twitter Xu Chonglang: Just finished watching the last episode of 'Billions' Season 7 yesterday. Lots of thoughts. Throughout the series, attention was primarily focused on three characters: Bobby, Prince, and Chuck. 'Billions' seems to be about the pursuit of money, telling the story of Wall Street hedge funds, but ultimately itâ€™s all about power.
