Truly a rarity, with exquisitely crafted visual language and dialogue that makes watching the movie feel like reading a novel. Although I haven&#39;t read the original book, this TV series is still an exceptional production. The characters come to life vividly, portraying images that compete with the ambiguous yet fitting imaginations of the readers. Many times, I see myself in the scenarios presented, silently observing those around me, questioning life and fate, refusing and compromising mentally, resisting and fleeing physically, all while feeling overwhelmed by inner confusion and weakness. Where can hope be found in life? How can one carve out a small corner in this world that truly belongs to them? When will the inner struggle and helplessness find peace? When can one truly love themselves?
