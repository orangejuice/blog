A true rarity, with incomparable exquisite cinematography and dialogue, watching the film feels like reading a novel. Although I haven't read the original work, this TV series is indeed a marvelous production. The characters come alive, and the images they interpret can equal any reader's imagination that is vague yet characteristic. I can see myself reflected in many places, silently observing my surroundings, questioning life and fate. The mental refusal and compromise, the resistance and escape in action, the confusion and weakness in the heart cover everything. Where is the hope of life? How can I have my own little corner in this world? When will my inner powerlessness and struggle come to peace? When can I love myself?
