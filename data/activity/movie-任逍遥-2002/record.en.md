Talking about urban style, despite all the loopholes you can find in Jia Zhangke's movies, they are absolutely transcendent in reflecting the characteristics of their time, far beyond their contemporary mainstream filmmakers. I watched 'Unknown Pleasures' last night, the theme of which is the ridiculous things that happened during the economic transition at the turn of the millennium.
