Finally finished reading, it's very exciting and not hard to read. If, like me, your understanding of this history comes from middle school textbooks, it's worth reading. The book doesn't have much narration about the war itself, it mainly revolves around the trade between the two countries, the situation of the Thirteen Factories, the smuggling of opium, and how things step by step developed to the point of war.
