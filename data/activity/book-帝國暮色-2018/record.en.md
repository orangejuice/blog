Via tw ke bing finally finished reading it, it's fascinating and not difficult to read. If, like me, all your knowledge of this period of history comes from middle school textbooks, it's still worth a read. The book does not delve much into the war itself, but focuses on the trade between the two countries, the state of the Thirteen Factories, the smuggling of opium, and how things gradually escalated to war.
