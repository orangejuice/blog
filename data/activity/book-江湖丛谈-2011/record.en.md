What is Jianghu? What are the ways of the world? This book provides insightful and clear observations with interesting descriptions of Jianghu tactics, all presented in colloquial language. It advises people not to be greedy or fooled, and to follow the right path, showing that its target readers are ordinary people. Within the vast, enclosed geographical and cultural space, social evolution pushes the philosophy of jungle survival to an extreme: taking full advantage of information gaps, humanity's weaknesses, and psychological control techniques to deceive, cheat, and exploit, treating people as prey for maximum value. These manipulative skills are painstakingly honed, even evolving into a form of highly entertaining art. The use of jargon not only avoids inviting bad luck but also builds industry barriers, while highlighting the deep-rooted history and long tradition of ellipsis and cryptic writing in Chinese culture. The simplicity, hardworking but fatal nature of the lower end of the information gap food chain, contrasted with the cunning, skillful, and wealthy but unfulfilled life at the top resembles a theater, where the dust and noise do not touch the reader's clothes yet the familiar aura in the air silently reminds the audience that they're from this world, in this world, and can't expect to live in isolation.
