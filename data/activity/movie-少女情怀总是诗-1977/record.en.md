The screen is full of young girls' bodies, which is astonishing and doubtful, filling my adolescent years with blankness - such a shame there's no such thing as a next life. This film's generous display of the narrative from a girl's perspective is rare; it definitely can't be compared to youth films that flaunt naive shyness. Furthermore, this film was produced in 1977!
