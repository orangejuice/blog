The screen filled with the bodies of young girls truly astonishes and raises doubts. My youth was a blank slate, and sadly, there's no next life to make up for it. The narrative from a young girl's perspective, with its unabashed display of visuals, is rare. Pure and shy youth films can't even compare. Also - this film was made in 1977!
