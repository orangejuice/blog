The story structure is quite innovative. The downsides are that some of the acting and plot points feel a bit forced, weakening the persuasiveness of the expression. The unfolding of the story under the protagonist's halo also significantly weakens the thematic force. However, there are places in the plot that touch me from time to time, getting me deeply engaged and leading me step by step to the root of despair. I think the ending is also not impressive enough. I interpret it as making the protagonist in the real timeline of 1979 echo the timeline at the start of the movieâ€”which doesn't satisfy the expectation of a deeper exploration after such long sentiments, it's disappointing. It lost the soul and support of the character, and my sense of despair almost completely dissipated, turning it only into the feeling of watching a half-cooked plastic film.
