An intriguing story structure. The drawbacks include some admittedly contrived performances and plot points that diminish its persuasive power. The focus on the male lead diminishes the thematic depth somewhat, but there are moments in the plot that do touch me, driving me to despair, watching with doubts about where the future lies, moving step by step toward the root of despair. The ending also lacked brilliance; I interpret it as an attempt to echo the start of the movie with the real timeline in 1979â€”this arrangement failed to satisfy the yearning for a deeper exploration after so much melancholy. It was disappointing, losing the characters' souls and support, and leaving me with almost all of my sense of despair relieved, turning to just watching a half-baked plastic movie.
