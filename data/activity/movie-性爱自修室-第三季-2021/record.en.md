A series you don't want to finish. The visuals are exquisite, the story is tight and powerful, the rhythm is well controlled, and it embodies both artistic beauty and a humanistic flavor. Modern social reality is well absorbed, refined, and blends into the construction of a clear and somewhat fantastical egalitarian school society. Each distinctive and impressive protagonist is undergoing their unique adventures and continuous growth. In this simulated experiment, it seems that one can find a direction or an answer. There is nothing particularly new; it is the eternal pursuit of freedom that is often discussed. What's new is this student-led confrontation against conservatism in thinking, an attempt to consolidate a suppressive status over students and an unwillingness to change and advance. As Xun Lu once said, 'So many people, just rolling in the dust, when they are young, they are not treated as humans, when they grow up, they can't become humans.' The way education is conducted reflects the level of development of a society, civilization, or species. The gentle unyielding rationality embodied in this play is such a great healing.
