A series I didn't want to see end. The visuals are refined, the story compact and powerful, the pacing steady, embodying both artistic beauty and a humane touch. The harsh realities of modern society are well-absorbed and distilled, constructing a clear, rational yet slightly fantastical egalitarian school microcosm. Every character, vivid and memorable, undergoes their unique adventures and grows continuously. In this simulated experiment, it seems one could find a direction or answer, yet there's nothing particularly novel, still revolving around the timeless pursuit of freedom. What's new is the student-led challenge against conservative thinking, seeking to cement oppression over students, uninterested in progress or change—a critique reminiscent of what Luxun once said: 'With so many people, they merely shuffle through the dust; not treated as human when young, and unable to become fully human as they grow.' The method of education reflects the level of development of a society, civilization, or species. The series showcases a flexible rational gentleness—truly therapeutic.
