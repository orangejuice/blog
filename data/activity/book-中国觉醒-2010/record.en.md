American missionary Ding Weiliang described his amazement experiencing Hangzhou for the first time in 1855, in his 1907 book 'China's Awakening'. He wrote: 'The city still retains majestic relics of the Southern Song imperial city. Decorating the West Lake are countless pavilions, lotus flowers, and water lilies, all exuding a royal charm; the long city wall encircles hills and valleys; the entire city is situated high above, overlooking a wide mouth of a river flowing into the sea. All these elements give this city its noble and solemn charm. We preached to a respectful audience in a public square. An elegantly dressed gentleman squeezed in and invited us to tea at his house, expressing that he would be ashamed if any Western scholars were to pass through their city without receiving any courtesies. How humble and hospitable! Could the Hebrews and Arabs be as welcoming?'
