via Twitter, Xu Laomao. American missionary Ding Weiliang described his awe-inspiring visit to Hangzhou in 1855 in his 1907 book 'The Awakening of China.' “This city still retains the magnificent relics of the Southern Song imperial city. Surrounded by the lake, countless pavilions, towers, and lotus ponds add a regal touch; encircled by a long wall, one can see hills and valleys; the city sits high and overlooks the wide mouth of a great river entering the sea. All these endow the city with a dignified and noble charm. We preached in a public square to a large and respectful audience, when a well-dressed gentleman squeezed through and invited us to his home for tea. He said that if those Western scholars passed through their city without showing respect, he would be ashamed. How humble and attentive! Could the Hebrews and Arabs be so warmly hospitable?”
