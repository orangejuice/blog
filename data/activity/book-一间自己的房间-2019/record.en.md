Via tw Stopping Cloud / via tw Little Bean I hope that everyone, no matter what means, can earn enough money to travel, to idle, to contemplate the past and the future of the world, to read books and dream, to wander around the street corners, letting the fishing line of thoughts deeply sink into the street flow. ——Virginia Woolf 'A Room of One's Own'
