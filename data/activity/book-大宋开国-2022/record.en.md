Originally published in 2009 via Twitter AC, and reprinted last year, "The Founding of the Great Song" is a high-quality popular historical book with smooth narration and easy reading. Oftentimes, one can feel the profound emotions of the author effusing from the pages. Unfortunately, Professor Fan Xuehui passed away prematurely in 2019 at the age of 49.
