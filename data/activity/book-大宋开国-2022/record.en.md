Originally published in 2009 and reprinted last year, 'The Founding of the Great Song Dynasty' is a high-quality, easy-reading historical narrative, where the reader can often sense the author's profound emotions unconsciously. Unfortunately, Professor Fan Xuehui passed away prematurely at the age of 49 in 2019.
