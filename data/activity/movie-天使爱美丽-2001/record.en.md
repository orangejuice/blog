Amélie is sensitive and lives in a richly imaginative world, filled with romanticism. By a twist of fate, the forty-year-old box at the foot of the wall opened up Amélie's altruistic sentiments to uphold justice. The positive feedback received was captured by her, so she continued to pursue righteousness. She fantasized that her loved one would surprise her when she needed him the most, and soon it was delivered by the god of fate. The beautiful aspects that are fragile, precious, fragmented, and lucky can only be realized in film.
