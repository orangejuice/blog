Amélie has a sensitive inner world, breathing life into a rich fantasy realm filled with romanticism. A fortuitous event leads her to discover a box hidden for forty years at the base of a wall, sparking her wonderful spirit of benevolence and justice. The positive feedback she receives inspires her to continue her chivalrous deeds. She fantasizes about her beloved appearing just when she needs him the most, and sure enough, fate delivers him right to her doorstep. The fragile, precious, fragmented, and fortunate beauty that only exists in films is realized.
