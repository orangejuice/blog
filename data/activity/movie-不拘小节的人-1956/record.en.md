Highly creative and satirical, this film aims at public morality and virtues. It is a well-structured work that was made with sincerity, and it causes one to sigh at the changes that have taken place. The actors are also excellent. It features the West Lake in Hangzhou in the early days after the founding of the People's Republic of China.
