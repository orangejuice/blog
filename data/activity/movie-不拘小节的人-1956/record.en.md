Highly creative and sharply satirical, this film aims its sights at public morals and good customs. It's a work with a complete structure, earnest sincerity, and evokes a nostalgic sigh for how the world has changed. The acting is also excellent, featuring early post-revolutionary Hangzhou's West Lake.
