Watched the book all day via tw orange, absolutely binge-worthy. I didn’t quite understand it the first time I read it. The second time, after putting it into practice and watching explanations on Bilibili, I got it. It's a fantastic book of insights and patterns. Might need a third read to use it flexibly.
