Via Wang Xiaobo Bronze Age 'My perspective is quite different from Modiano's. He treats memory as a positive thing that the protagonist strives to pursue; I regard memory as detestable, accepting it like bitter medicine. My memory has not fully recovered, but I already feel it's too much, wishing I could forget some of it. But as you know, he and I share a common belief, that is, the loss of memory is a significant theme, and memory itself, is a fundamental area that is inescapable. For this reason, I hope everyone reads 'Honeymoon Street'. As for my book, whether you read it or not is up to you.'
