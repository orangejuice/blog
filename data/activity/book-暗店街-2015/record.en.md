Via Wang Xiaobo, The Bronze Age: "My views are very different from Modiano's. He regards memory as something positive, compelling his characters to pursue it relentlessly; while I regard memory as something distasteful, accepted like bitter medicine. My memory has not fully recovered, but I already feel it's enough, wishing I could forget some of it. Yet as you know, he and I agree on one point: the loss of memory is a significant topic, and memory itself is a fundamental domain, inescapable. For this reason, I hope everyone reads 'Honeymoon'. As for my book, whether to read it or not is up to you."
