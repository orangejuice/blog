The film has a magic that spreads me out from the anxiety of sitting in the afternoon room. The music is beautifully soothing, with surging waves and Japanese interactions. The female protagonist is always colorful, and the gaze ahead is charming. Her small oval face and broken bangs are never monotonous. Quiet and delicate, it's trivial but not boring. It's about life on the margin of the world, about life, pure love and companionship, about the life force that we don't know, in a story of a deaf-mute surfing.
