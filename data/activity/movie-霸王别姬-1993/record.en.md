Survival is brutal, fate is merciless. One cannot control one’s own body or words. A trivial life means nothing in the face of vast societal changes. Reality is absurd, dreams are pathetic and contemptible. To exist is to grovel and bend the knee, dirtying the soul, demons thrive in joy. What a land of suffering, the most helpless thing is that it’s all predetermined. Living is difficult, is it just to barely keep breathing?
