What strikes me is that this one and a half hour plot is all too common, yet someone paid attention and persistently turned it into a work. The plot is so commonplace that it bored me, but it makes one reflect on why a little child, confined by a small family household, should endure the conflicts of parents' quarrels, unable to escape and having to face their fate - this predicament is not normal. The performance of the young actor is outstanding.
