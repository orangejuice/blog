What moved me is that this hour and a half plot is so common, and some people would pay attention and persistently turn it into a work. It's so common that the plot makes me feel bored, but it makes people think, why should a child confined in a small family in modern society suffer the quarrels and conflicts of his parents, and can't escape but can only face fate, this commonality is not normal. The performance of the young actor is excellent.
