Via tw rewolf, 'Regardless of how old your child is, he will remind you of the emotions you experienced at his age through his actions. Children are truly miraculous beings. When you always feel angry at some of their behaviors, you may be feeling angry or helpless for a stage of yourself. Before raising your hand to hit your child, take some effort to understand yourself again. The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read.'
