Via tw rewolf 'No matter how old your child is, he will always act in a way that reminds you of the emotions you experienced at his age.'
Children are truly amazing beings.
When you are always angry about certain behaviors of your child, it might be that you are angry or helpless about yourself at a certain stage.
Before you lay a hand on the child,
make an effort to get to know yourself again.
