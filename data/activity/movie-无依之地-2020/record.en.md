Almost recommended, but perhaps overhyped; it left me not quite satisfied, with a feeling of loss. Maybe because it focuses on a niche aspect of American life that feels too distant for me to resonate with. It closely mirrors the essence of real life, raising questions about what life is. There were moments when the transition from the wilderness to urban life made me intensely despise the narrow-mindedness, naivety, and petty lives of people both on and off the screen - a disdain for both cities and their inhabitants. The style is calm and delicate, distinctly American and boldly individualistic, unlike the subdued healing characteristic of Japanese styles.
