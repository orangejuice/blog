This film fell slightly short of a recommendation, perhaps because the fervent promotion raised expectations too high. It wasn't as moving as expected, leaving a sense of unsatisfied disappointment. Maybe it’s because the film focuses on the life of a corner of the USA that is too distant for me to resonate with. However, the film is very close to the essence of life, prompting the question of what life really is. There was a moment when I found myself hating the city when the story shifted from the wilderness to urban life. I despise the narrow-mindedness, blind naiveté and mediocrity of urban living. The style is calm and delicate, but completely different from Japanese restraint and healing. It’s very American - tough, individualistic, and flamboyant.
