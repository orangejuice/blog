One of NHK's finest works, it's hard to imagine the amount of effort and budget that was planned to create two refined and complete historical episodes. The production attitude is evident in its seriousness and meticulousness. The production team must have a unique understanding and feeling of regret for this period of history. The cross-border emotions incorporated in the film are especially moving. Many of the recreated scenes are just right, and the overall respect and humanistic romance is truly spectacular. A must-watch.
