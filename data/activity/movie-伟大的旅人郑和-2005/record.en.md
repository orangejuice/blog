One of NHK's best works, it's hard to imagine how much effort and cost were planned and coordinated to create two condensed and complete historical stories, showing the seriousness and meticulousness of the production attitude. The production team must have a unique understanding, feelings and regret for this part of history. The transnational feelings integrated into the film are especially touching. Many of the reproduced scenes are just right, and overall it is full of respect and a romantic atmosphere of humanities, which is really wonderful. It's a must-watch.
