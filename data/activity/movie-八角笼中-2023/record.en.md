Via tw li4more Just finished watching 'In The Octagon', it's quite good. It's hard for a poor kid to change his destiny. A line in the movie goes well, a stone that floats on water will sink after a few plops. 'I control my own fate, not by the heavens', it's easier said than done. Imvihv True, the pit poor people encounter in their lifetime is bigger, even if they have had smooth sailing for a while, it is inevitable that they will be beaten back to their original spot when the next pit comes.
