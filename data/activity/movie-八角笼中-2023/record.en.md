Just finished watching 'In the Octagon,' pretty good. It's too hard for a poor child to change their fateâ€”one line in the movie put it so well, 'Stones that skim will eventually sink despite a few flutters.' 'I control my destiny, not the heavens,' easier said than done. Indeed, the poor face more pitfalls in life; even if there's a smooth ride for a while, it's hard not to fall back into another pit eventually.
