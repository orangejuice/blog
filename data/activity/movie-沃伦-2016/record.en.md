Volhynia, a film about the massacre of Poles by Ukrainians during World War II, begins with a beautiful traditional country wedding scene. The exchange of glances and tender feelings between the leading lady and the young man she fancies made me suddenly realize: without the mutual feelings of young and hormone-rushed love, what else can sustain you to live through the dog-shitty middle age?
