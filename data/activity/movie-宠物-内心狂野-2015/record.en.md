A rather relaxing and healing documentary, filled with fluffy, adorable, and warm-hearted little animals. It contains many obscure facts, such as how guinea pig fathers wait around for guinea pig mothers to give birth, and post-birth... Domesticated cats no longer leave their own scent to demonstrate their submissiveness. The camera positions are too perfect, and each little story seems like it was edited to follow a narrative, losing a bit of authenticity. I really like the horses, big and robust, with gentle eyes, providing a sense of security.
