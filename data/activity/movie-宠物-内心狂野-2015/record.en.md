This is a rather relaxing and healing documentary, full of adorable and heartwarming animals. There are a lot of little-known facts. For instance, guinea pig fathers stay to wait for the guinea pig mothers during childbirth... Tamed cats no longer leave their scent to demonstrate their obedience. The camera placement is too perfect, each little story seems to be edited according to the narrative, which takes away some authenticity. Really like the horse, big and strong, its gentle eyes bring great security.
