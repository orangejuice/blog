via tw hunter Sue Liang reposted Elon Musk: Change the programs that someone else put in your mind. To further understand this phenomenon, you can take a look at Virus of the Mind. This book, from the perspective of memetics, elaborates in detail how we are brainwashed by our surrounding environment as we grow. Socrates once said that an unexamined life is not worth living. The greatest tragedy in life is to be influenced by toxic ideas from our early growing environment, not disconnecting from these circuits in time, and then continuing to live under the torment of these ideas due to inertia.
