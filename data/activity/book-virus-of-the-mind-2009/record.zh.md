  title: Virus of the Mind
  subtitle: Brodie, Richard / 2009
  intro: "Virus of the Mind is the first popular book devoted to the science of
    memetics, a controversial new field that transcends psychology, biology,
    anthropology, and cognitive science. Memetics is the science of memes, the
    invisible but very real DNA of human society. In Virus of the Mind,Richard
    Brodie carefully builds on the work of scientists Richard Dawkins, Douglas
    Hofstadter, Daniel Dennett, and others who have become fascinated with memes
    and their potential impact on our lives. But he goes beyond science and
    dives into the meat of the issue: is the emergence of this new science going
    to have an impact on our lives like the emergence of atomic physics did in
    the Cold War? Richard would say the impact will be at least as great. While
    atomic bombs affect everybody's life, viruses of the mind touch lives in a
    more personal and more pernicious way. Mind viruses have already infected
    governments, educational systems, and inner cities, leading to some of the
    most pervasive and troublesome problems of society today: youth gangs, the
    welfare cycle, the deterioration of the public schools, and ever-growing
    government bureaucracy.  Viruses of the mind are not a future worry: they
    are here with us now and are evolving to become better and better at their
    job of infecting us. The recent explosion of mass media and the information
    superhighway has made the earth a prime breeding ground for viruses of the
    mind. Will there be a mental plague? Will only some of us survive with our
    free will intact? Richard Brodie weaves together science, ethics, and
    current events as he raises these and other very disturbing questions about
    memes."

想要进一步了解这种现象可以看一下Virus of the mind。这本书从模因学的角度详细地介绍了我们是怎么被周围的成长环境洗脑的。

苏格拉底说过未经审视的生活是不值得过的。人生最大的悲剧就是被早期成长环境中的有毒思想影响，没有及时和这些回路断开连接，然后因为惯性，在这些思想的折磨下继续活着。
