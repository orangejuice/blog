A uniquely modern approach to historical writing, the examples are particularly well-chosen and this impressed me deeply. Complex feelings arise when reading. Works like this are too scarce. The vocabularies, gradually forgotten as one grows, are revived in this slim volume, just as often described, familiar yet strange. This place sorely needs such observations, such a record.
