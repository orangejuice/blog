This unique modern historiography made a deep impression on me with its well-chosen examples. Its complexity evokes complex emotions upon reading. Such works are much needed. These gradually forgotten vocabulary in our development have been awakened in this not-thick book, just like the phrase often used to describe, familiar strangers. This place greatly needs such observations, greatly needs such records.
