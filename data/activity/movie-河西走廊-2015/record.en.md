The first three episodes are five-star quality. They are well-made, with a well-structured story, historically accurate depiction, and immersive experience as if one is silently witnessing drastic changes. The music score is majestic, desolate, and saddening, leaving a profound impression. The production quality truly ranks among the top tier in Mandarin documentaries. However, this doesn't mean that the usual propaganda phrases, the arrogant demeanor, and verbose expressions filled with overly intense emotions and descriptive poetry suddenly disappear. Focusing on macro, overall, historical significance, political correctness, it's all about the utilization and requisition of the Hexi Corridor. The appreciation, gratitude, reciprocation, and portrayal of ordinary people's real lives are missing, lacking a humane and compassionate spirit and perspective. This is a fatal flaw for a work of art. If it were only three episodes, it would have no problem getting five stars, but ten episodes is a little overwhelming.
