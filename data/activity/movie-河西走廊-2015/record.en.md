The first three episodes are five-star. Elegantly made, with a logical narrative and a performance imbued with a sense of history, it feels like truly observing drastic historical changes from the sidelines. The music is majestically solemn and melancholically deep, leaving a lasting impression. This production quality is indeed top-tier among Mandarin documentaries. However, this does not mean the usual promotional rhetoric, an aloof and proud demeanor, and a lot of verbose, emotional gibberish in poetic form have disappeared. Focused on the grand scheme, historical significance, and political correctness, it speaks only of exploiting and demanding from the Hexi Corridor, failing to show gratitude, reciprocation, or the real lives of ordinary people, lacking a humane, empathetic spirit and perspective. This is a fatal flaw for a work of art. If it ended at three episodes, it would undoubtedly earn five stars, but ten episodes are a bit too much to handle.
