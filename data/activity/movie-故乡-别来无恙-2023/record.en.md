Tweet from Mickey M: 'I can't watch films like this anymore, those that make you cry and choke up from the start. They say drifting through life is hard, and terms like 'Beijing drifter' are popular, but the plight of kids drifting overseas is hardly any easier... Back then, a teacher in the East once said: 'In the future, everything you encounter will be harder than the sentences I'm asking you to write now.' These past years, experiencing the loss of close ones, family surgeries, and life's setbacks, you truly realize what it means to have a home you can't return to, a journey home too far and unachievable. Dad says I've grown up a lot over the years, but what lies behind that growth need not be mentioned. A popular saying goes, 'Life is a wilderness, not a track.' Let's encourage each other with that. Also, this is a good film, but I donâ€™t want to choke up, better to give it up.'
