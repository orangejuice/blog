Right now, I find it hard to watch tear-jerkers. You say life as a drifter is tough, even being a 'Beipiao' (a term for those drifting to the North for better opportunities), but isn't a child drifting overseas not much better... Once upon a time, a teacher in the east said: 'After you leave here, every challenge you encounter will be more difficult than the simple sentences I'm asking you to write now.' In recent years, I've experienced the deaths of loved ones, surgery of family members, and life's setbacks. Only then do you realize the poignancy of a home you can't return to, even if it's thousands of miles away, divided by mountains and seas, it's unreachable, out of your power. My father said I've grown quickly these last few years, but the reality behind that growth needs no explanation. I came across a rather energizing quote lately: 'Life is wilderness, not a track.' Well, let's inspire each other with that. On another note, this is a great film, but I don't want to be choked up, so I'm going to pass.
