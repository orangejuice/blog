A must-watch, with authentic content, actors, and revealing significant details! Some aspects aren't perfect, but such a unique production is well-done overall. Episode 2 made me cry. Episode 8 was desperate. Episode 10 had familiar plotlines. Life is so hard. Struggling, grappling, just to breathe a little longer.
