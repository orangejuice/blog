A must-watch, with content, actors, and revealed details that are quite realistic! Some details are not perfect, but such work is unique and well-produced. The second episode made me cry. The eighth one made me despair. The tenth one felt like a familiar storyline. It's so hard to survive. Struggling, fighting, just to catch one more breath.
