The storytelling is smooth. Very Japanese. Scar literature series. Beyond the familiar bustling city life, it's a story about the ordinary lives of ordinary people hidden in the crowd, plain yet full of scars. The pretty and sweet female landlord, using her deceased husband's ashes for self-comfort, stirred one of the few ripples in this 2-hour film.
