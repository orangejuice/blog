The infinitely sad year of 2020, a dirge of the times, an era dominated by smartphones and social networks. The focal point is excellent, the concept is clever, it's unclear how much non-technical professionals can resonate with it, but you can tell a lot of effort has been made to cater to them. Excellent work!
