The infinite sadness of 2020, the dirge of the era, a chronicle of humanity dominated by smartphones and social networks. The focus is excellent and the concept is cleverly devised. It's uncertain how much non-tech-savvy individuals can resonate with this, but it's evident that a lot of effort was made to accommodate them. A fine piece!
