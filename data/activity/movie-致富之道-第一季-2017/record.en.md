E1 'Luck' 'Desire to win everyone's respect' 'Failure is not an option' 'passion for beauty' / E2 'Born poor, aspiring for achievements' 'Provide the best service' Fixing pipes for the rich, planning parties for the rich 'The only one in the world doing this kind of business' The female host casually makes indecent jokes and physical contacts with the rich, and expresses her desire for money, which is in line with the theme of decadence in the world drunk in wealth. / E4 Successful people are often energetic and capable, willing to do any job. Believe in yourself, even if people think you're ignorant and foolish, hold on to the unyielding faith, believe in change, can't always be the product of the environment, get out, change your own surroundings.
