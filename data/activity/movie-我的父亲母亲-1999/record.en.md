This village girl is too beautiful, I've seen many classic stills over the years, and her performance in the film certainly does not disappoint. Because of this character's great success, the film is worth watching. The young man, in comparison, is rather lacking; his portrayal doesnâ€™t resemble a serious person, the character development is not well-rounded, with no psychological depth, and he doesn't come across as a good guy at all. The title might as well be changed to 'My Mother,' as it seems Director Zhang only has eyes for his actresses.
