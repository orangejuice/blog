In such a chaotic world, there are still things that bring peace and hope. The British drama 'Call the Midwife' has recently been one of my favorites, a group of people who are full of love, compassion, and integrity, portraying the brilliance of humanity. The nuns who adhere to their faith, the singing during evening prayers is like a sound from heaven, pure and steadfast, which is very touching.
