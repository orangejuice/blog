In such a tumultuous world, there remains something that offers tranquility and hope. The British series 'Call the Midwife' has recently become a favorite; it's about a group of people whose hearts are filled with love, compassion, integrity, and goodness, spreading the radiance of humanity. The devoted nuns, with their hymn-singing during evening prayers, sound like voices from heavenâ€”sacred and resolute, profoundly moving.
