Though the movie is modest, lacking dramatic twists and grand scenes, it felt comforting to watch. It's like observing the life of a small group at the margins of society, abandoned by everyone in the world. The cinematography is very well done, and the performances of the child actors deserve praise. The characters' quietness, some illogical developments and characters, and the bizarre cover design made it a little short of perfect.
