Although the film is quite plain with no dramatic twists or elaborate scenes, it feels refreshing to watch, like observing a small group living on the edges of society, abandoned by the world. The cinematography is masterfully handled, and the performances by the young actors are commendable. The characters are reticent, and some aspects of the story and character logic are weak. The cover design is bizarre, almost reaching perfection but just missing the mark.
