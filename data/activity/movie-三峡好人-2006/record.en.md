It's a comfortably soothing watch, comfort in its sadness and nudity, filling the lens with a rare humanistic perspective and pitying comfort. With its distinct historical imprint, it is a beautiful work of art, truly laborious for everyone involved, including the crew and the elderly actors. In the face of such relentless and rapid changes, the feelings of humans, these tiny creatures, are pitifully insignificant, just like the past thousands of years soon to be utterly forgotten. Several surreal scenes don't feel out of place at all. Finishing it makes one feel like chanting Amitabha and letting this life pass by.
