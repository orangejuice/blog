It's so comfortable to watch - comfortably sad, comfortably blunt. The camera is filled with a scarce humanistic perspective and the comfort of compassion. A striking historical imprint and a beautiful piece of work. Great efforts from this group of people, including the crew and the elder actors. In the face of the ruthless sudden changes in this sea of mulberry fields, the feelings of humans, these small creatures, are pitifully insignificant. It's just like the past thousands of years - soon to be forgotten completely. A few surreal scenes don't feel abrupt at all. After watching it, I just want to recite 'Ami Tuofo' for a lifetime.
