Via tw philo finished reading 'How's Your Summer?' (Kim Aeh-ran). A South Korean female author, it's a very nice collection of short stories with excellent writing. However, the tone of the stories is quite oppressive, depicting various suffering of humanity, very East Asian and very authentic. Each story is painfully profound to read.
