      comment: "The giant snake from the shadows of childhood only appears for a few
        minutes. These brief scenes remain fresh in my memory for two reasons:
        the snake wasn't as large as I remembered, although it could still
        almost fill the pipes; as the big boss behind the scenes, constantly
        calling out from within the walls to establish its presence, it was
        immediately blinded upon its debut, making it both fierce and pitifully
        pathetic."

The giant snake from the shadows of childhood only appears for a few minutes. Yet, those few minutes are vividly etched in my memory, offering a mix of feelings: the snake wasn't as large as I remembered, though it still nearly filled the circular pipes; as the big boss hidden within the walls, making its presence felt throughout the movie, it was pathetically fierce when it first appeared and was immediately blinded.
