  subtitle: Peter Hessler / 2024 / Penguin Press
  intro: >-
    An intimate and revelatory eyewitness account of two generations of students
    in China’s heartland, chronicling a country in the midst of tumultuous
    change through the prism of its education system

    More than twenty years after teaching English to China’s first boom
    generation at a small college in Sichuan Province, Peter Hessler returned to
    Sichuan to teach the next generation. At the same time, Hessler and his wife
    enrolled their twin daughters in a local state-run elementary school, where
    they were the only Westerners in a student body of about two thousand. Over
    the years, Hessler had kept in close contact with more than a hundred of his
    former students, who were now in their forties. By reconnecting with these
    individuals—members of China’s “Reform generation” —while teaching current
    undergrads, Hessler was able to gain a unique perspective on China's
    incredible transformation over the past quarter-century.

    In the late 1990s, almost all of Hessler's students were the first member of
    their extended families to become educated. Their parents were subsistence
    farmers who could offer little guidance as their children entered a
    brand-new world. By 2019, when Hessler arrived at Sichuan University, he
    found a very different China and a new kind of student—an only child whose
    schooling was the object of intense focus from a much more ambitious and
    sophisticated cohort of parents. Hessler’s new students have a sense of
    irony about the regime but mostly navigate its restrictions with equanimity,
    and embrace the astonishing new opportunities China’s boom affords. But the
    pressures of this system of extreme “meritocracy” at scale can be gruesome,
    even for much younger children, including his own daughters, who give him
    and his wife an intimate view into the experience at their local school.

    In Peter Hessler’s hands, China’s education system is the perfect vehicle
    for examining what’s happened to the country, where it’s going, and what we
    can learn from it, for good and ill. At a time when anti-Chinese rhetoric in
    America has grown blunter and uglier, Other Rivers is a tremendous, indeed
    an essential gift, a work of enormous human empathy that rejects cheap
    stereotypes and shows us China from the inside out and the bottom up, using
    as a measuring stick this most universally relatable set of experiences. As
    both a window onto China and a distant mirror onto America and its own
    education system, Other Rivers is a classic, a book of tremendous value and
    compelling human interest.
