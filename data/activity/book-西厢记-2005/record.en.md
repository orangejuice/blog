Truly a charming tale, the original text is a bit challenging to digest, which is a pity, but fortunate that the translation is also wonderfully flavored. The story of Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying has been cherished and imagined by many generations, and reaching my hands today, it feels like a dream. Although this love is bitter and beautiful, creating a proud and fulfilling life, few have the talent, ambition, luck, and striking beauty, nor the eloquent and righteous matchmaker or the persistence and seriousness of the characters in the drama. Most people can only look up and sigh at the grand joys and pains of such love. Such passionate characters, perhaps after enduring hardships, are ultimately let down. This is also why beautiful love is rare, and why 'The Romance of the Western Chamber' continues to be treasured today.
