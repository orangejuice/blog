Indeed, the original text is quite a charming tale, but a bit hard to chew on. It's such a pity. Thankfully, the translation is fantastic, with a unique flavor. The story of Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying has been held in the hearts and minds of numerous generations, being dreamt about and savoring its fantasy. Now that it has come into my hands, it feels quite dreamlike. However, this kind of love, as bitter as it is beautiful, contributes greatly to an accomplished life. How many possess the talents, ambitions, luck, and beauty, enjoy the company of silver-tongued and just matchmakers, or have the determination and seriousness of the characters in the play? Most people can likely only sigh in awe of such a poignant and beautiful love story. These passionate characters are likely to have experienced bitterness, probably to be let down in the end. This is also why true love is so precious and why the romance of the West Chamber continues to be passed down.
