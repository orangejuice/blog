The cinematic experience was quite good, though there seemed to be a few issues with speaker distortion. The film is full of Chinese elements, reviving numerous mythical creatures and featuring a dragon as a key member fiercely battling evil forces. The portrayal of a utopian haven nearly touches the heart. The adept use of special effects definitely earns an extra point. A cast of Asian characters constantly speaking Mandarin hints at a new era in cinema, where Asians are featured not just in Western lives but in their own stories. The traditional Eastern father figure, dictating children's lives and pursuing an ideal fairy-tale maiden, is ultimately rejected by the younger generation. Plot-wise, it's quite dull, just following the usual patterns: a peaceful life disrupted, a legendary past ensnaring an innocent yet potentially powerful protagonist, comedic characters to lighten the mood (seems familiar), a bad guy turned good, muscular heroes, and thrilling fight scenes. Tony Leung's portrayal of Xu 'the elder' as a gangster allied with evil forces was surprisingly fitting. It's a movie worth watching, but overall, it's nothing spectacular, just an entertaining flick.
