The cinema experience was quite good, although there seemed to be some blown speakers. The film is replete with Chinese elements and resurrects many mythical creatures, with dragons playing a crucial role in the fierce battles against the evil forces. The depiction of the idyllic paradise is somewhat moving. The proficient use of special effects is definitely a plus. With several Asian characters continuously speaking Mandarin, it may signify a new era in film and television where Asians not only appear in the lives of Westerners, but also in their stories. The traditional father figure from the East (who prescribes the lives of his children, pursues the ideal woman), is ultimately completely rejected by the younger generation. The plot is quite boring, full of cliches. The peaceful life is disrupted, and the innocent but potential-laden protagonist is drawn into legendary past events. There are funny characters to lighten the mood, villains turning good, buff men, and exciting fight sequences. Tony Leung actually played a great role as a gangster boss in collusion with evil forces. It's a movie worth watching, but overall it's not that great, just an entertaining film.
