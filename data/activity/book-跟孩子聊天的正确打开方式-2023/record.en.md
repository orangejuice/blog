This booklet is gifted from Via tw plantegg to all parents. It has received a high score of 9.3 on Douban. I bought it at the lowest price available online, only 19 yuan. It solved my big problem. I always want to chat with them every day, but apart from asking 'what is fun and interesting today', I really ran out of things to say. This is the parents' cheat sheet but don't let the kid discover it.
