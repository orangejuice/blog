A handy booklet gifted by Via tw plantegg to all parents, scoring 9.3 on Douban. I found it at the lowest price online, bought it for 19 yuan. It truly solved my major issue; I always wanted to chat with them daily, but often found myself running out of words after asking what was fun or interesting today. It's a parent's cheat sheetâ€”just don't let the kids find out.
