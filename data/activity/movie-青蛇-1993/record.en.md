The music is incredibly beautiful, but the unique post-production marked by the era makes the visual effects somewhat compromised. The story features a poor scholar and a devoted, gentle, and incredibly powerful beauty of a goddess. Some metaphors and subtle expressions successfully deceived my younger eyes. I came to this world and was misunderstood by people. You say there is love in the world, but what is love really?
