The music is incredibly beautiful, and the distinctive post-production marked by the times makes the visual effects discounted. The story features a characteristically poor scholar and a beautiful fairy who is gentle and incomparably powerful. Some metaphorical and implicit expressions successfully deceived my young eyes. I came to the world and was misunderstood by the world. You say there is love in the world, but what is love?
