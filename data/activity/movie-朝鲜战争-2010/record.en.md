The narration is verbose, and the content is not tightly packed or concise, giving a feeling of padding the word count in composition writing, which affects the viewing experience, especially in the last episode. It might be that I haven't come to understand this period of history yet. I will revisit it in the future. But, it is helpful in understanding this history.
