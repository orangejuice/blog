The narrative is verbose, and the content arrangement is not compact or concise, giving a sense of padding the word count like a school essay, which significantly affects the viewing experience, particularly in the final episode. It might be due to my lack of understanding of this history, and I may revisit it later. However, it is still very helpful for understanding this period.
