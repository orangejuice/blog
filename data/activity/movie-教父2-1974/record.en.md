The Godfather's rise was influenced by local gangsters and neighbors, showcasing the amusing and lamentable randomness of fate. His son Michael inadvertently became the heir. He is decisive, assertive, but does not get along with family or enemies. Even his wife and brothers do not stand with him, the family is no longer close, conducting ruthless business unlike his father who was generous. He's growing lonelier and unlike his father, he lacks warmth, generosity, humility, and grace, making the story completely unrecognizable.
