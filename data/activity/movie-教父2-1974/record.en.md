The founding of the Corleone family was influenced by local gangsters and neighbors, showcasing the whimsical and pitiable randomness of fate. Son Michael unexpectedly becomes the successor. While decisive and effective, his relationships with both family and foes are strained; even his wife and brother are not aligned with him. The family is no longer close-knit, conducting ruthless business, unlike his father who was benevolent and generous. Increasingly isolated, he lacks his father's warmth, humility, and generosity, thus transforming the story into something completely different.
