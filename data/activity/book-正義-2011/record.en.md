The version I read was the Taiwanese edition translated into simplified Chinese. Overall, the layout had no issues, and I'm very grateful. The book is lengthy and rich in content. Given that it originates from a classroom setting, the publicly available course is also highly recommended. This book is fantastic, offering a detailed yet unencumbered discussion around justice, which has slightly altered my perspective. The debate on social issues and broad citizen participation is perpetually needed by society, applicable even to alien races, as long as development continues and new issues are raised. Just like individual relationships, societies and groups also need to build healthy, cooperative, and friendly egalitarian relationships.
