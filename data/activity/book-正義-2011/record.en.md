The version I read was translated from Taiwanese to Simplified Chinese; the general layout did not present any problems, for which I am very grateful. The book is not short, and its content is rich. I believe that since it originates from the classroom, the corresponding open course is also worth watching. This book is splendid, revolving around justice for a detailed but not tedious discussion. It also altered my point of view: debates on social issues and widespread citizen participation are always needed in society, even for extraterrestrial civilizations, as long as they continue to evolve and new problems arise. Between individuals and groups, just like between people, it is necessary to build a healthy, supportive, friendly, and equitable relationship.
