Very Italian. The entertaining conversations, apartment neighbors, cultural characteristics, and story themes all originate from Italy, dedicated to Italy. The ending was incredibly powerful. Before knowing the context, one could never guess that a precious piece of paper symbolizing freedom was actually a political ballot! The whole film is a calm and clever buildup, shining a light straight to the audience's heart at the end. I admit that I was shallow this time, I guessed it was a ticket to America.
