Very Italian in essence. The conversations are witty, the neighborhood settings, cultural character, and thematic storytelling all stem from Italy and are dedicated to Italy. The ending is powerful and unexpected without prior knowledge of the context; a precious piece of paper symbolizing freedom turns out to be a political ballot! The whole film is a clever setup that directs a beam of light right into the audience's heart at the end. I must admit I was superficial, having guessed it was a boat ticket to America.
