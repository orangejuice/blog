Although it is a mediocre consumer entertainment program, the souls of the 'Friends' make it flesh and blood and bring it to life. The off-screen footage, the off-screen protagonists, and their special emotions towards their own roles and the people they worked with for ten years are all precious. In this world, there are always some people who are more fortunate than ordinary people, and they are them. They are able to observe and experience the world in a unique, successful and unparalleled way because of this drama. I wonder what is the world like in their eyes.
