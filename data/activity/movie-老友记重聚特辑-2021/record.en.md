Although it is an averagely scripted piece of consumable entertainment, it is imbued with the souls of old friends, giving it flesh and life. Off-screen shots, the off-screen protagonists and their special emotions with their own characters and those they've worked with for ten years are all precious. In this world, there are always those whose luck far exceeds the ordinary. They are such people. Because of this show, they are able to observe and experience the world through a uniquely successful and unparalleled perspective. What does their world look like in their eyes?
