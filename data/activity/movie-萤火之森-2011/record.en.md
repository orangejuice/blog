Such a short film managed to steal all my tears, so annoying. This movie is brief yet powerful, capturing the essence. What is love? Random encounters, moments of waiting, missing, and reluctant partings. The days spent together are silly, simple, and joyful. Over time, when realization dawns, you find yourself unwilling and unable to separate. The 'untouchable' setting captured my heart. Those few seconds when you can finally embrace tightly, what an incomparable feeling that must be? I really want to experience it myself. I want to meet Gin... / I want to touch Gin...
