  title: 30 Lessons for Living
  subtitle: Karl Pillemer / 2011 / Hudson Street Press
  intro: >-
    More than one thousand extraordinary Americans share their stories and the
    wisdom they have gained on living, loving, and finding happiness.

    After a chance encounter with an extraordinary ninety-year-old woman,
    renowned gerontologist Karl Pillemer began to wonder what older people know
    about life that the rest of us don't.

    His quest led him to interview more than one thousand Americans over the age
    of sixty-five to seek their counsel on all the big issues- children,
    marriage, money, career, aging. Their moving stories and uncompromisingly
    honest answers often surprised him. And he found that he consistently heard
    advice that pointed to these thirty lessons for living. Here he weaves their
    personal recollections of difficulties overcome and lives well lived into a
    timeless book filled with the hard-won advice these older Americans wish
    someone had given them when they were young.

    Like This I Believe, StoryCorps's Listening Is an Act of Love, and Tuesdays
    with Morrie, 30 Lessons for Living is a book to keep and to give. Offering
    clear advice toward a more fulfilling life, it is as useful as it is
    inspiring.
