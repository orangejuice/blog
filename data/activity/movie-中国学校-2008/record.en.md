I never expected it to unfold like this before watching, but after seeing it, I can't imagine a better development. It captures the world through the eyes of its characters. Apart from some deliberately arranged multi-angle dialogue shots, which are quite jarring, the rest of the time I didn't even feel like I was watching a film. Cultural barriers did not affect the capture of the essence at all. It embodies the texture of that era, a high-standard contemporary documentary. Over a decade, some things have completely changed, yet some remain exactly the same.
