Unexpected unfolding if you haven't seen it, it couldn't be better if you have. Seeing the world through the characters' eyes, barring the deliberately arranged multi-angle dialogue shots that are extremely abrupt, you wouldn't feel like you are watching a film at other times. Cultural barriers have not affected the key captures at all. The texture of that era, high-quality contemporary records. In over a decade, some things have already changed drastically but some things have not changed at all.
