This movie is quite flawed, almost hysterical. It's completely unclear what it wants to express, except for the director's deep-seated American individual heroism and the unabashed praise for America that starts from childhood. Was it made just for this? After watching it, I realized, isn't this just a complete fool? The hearts of the Americans and the day fool’s antics. 1 point for the scene reconstruction. It couldn’t have been made this way without some hysteria, a superbly crafted scene matched with a lousy story. Such great scenes wasted, along with my booze.
