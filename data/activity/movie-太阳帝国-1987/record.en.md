This movie is a bit problematic, almost hysterical. It's completely unclear what it wants to express, other than the deep-rooted American individual heroism from childhood and unabashed worship of America in the director's heart. Was this the reason for making this film? Recovering from the shock after watching, isn't this just a disaster, showcasing both American and Japanese interests? I'll give one point for the reconstruction of the scenes. No one could make such a mess without being hysterical, superb scenes paired with a terrible story. What a waste of such good scenes, and my wine as well.
