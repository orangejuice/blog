From Twitter, Tingyun: Yasushi Inoue's 'The Tale of Yang Guifei' lacks the intense character portrayal found in 'The Scales of the Gods' and 'Dunhuang'. Both Yang Guifei and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang are portrayed somewhat vaguely. The 'old ruler,' in particular, resembles the forever unseen 'Master' in Zhang Yimou's 'Raise the Red Lantern'. It's hard to discern his love for Yang Guifei, filling the void with capricious favoritism towards An Lushan, much like to a pet cat or dog. Yet, it is clear that the Anshi Rebellion was not sparked by a disastrous infatuation.
