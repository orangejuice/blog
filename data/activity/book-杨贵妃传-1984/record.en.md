Via tw Yun Stop Inoue Yasushi's 'The Legend of Yang Guifei' lacks the strong characterization found in 'The Scale of Justice' and 'Dunhuang'. Both Yang Guifei and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang are indistinctly portrayed. This 'old ruler' seems akin to the 'master' in Zhang Yimou's 'Raise the Red Lantern,' whose face is always hidden. It is hard to perceive his love for Yang Guifei, coupled with inexplicable capricious favor towards An Lushan as if treating a pampered pet cat or dog. Yet at least, the An Lushan Rebellion was not triggered by the catastrophic beauty.
