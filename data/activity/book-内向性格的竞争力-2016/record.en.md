Currently, this is quite a thorough explanation book about introversion I've read, offering valuable insights. The examples are plentiful and many resonate with my experiences, making me feel I'm not alone or unusual. Unfortunately, the translation is mediocre at best; some sentences are awkward and the overall translation feels too literal, which detracts from the experience.
