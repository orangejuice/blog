Currently, this is the most comprehensive explanatory book on introversion that I've read. It's worth understanding, with numerous and relatable examples that make me feel less alone and less unique. Regrettably, the translation leaves much to be desired, with sentences that are hard to decipher and an overall strong translation taste - quite a letdown.
