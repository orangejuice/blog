via Twitter: Idol-style scripter - This new David Fincher's 'The Killer' is recommended for everyone involved in trading, you'll gain something after watching. / via Twitter: Indigo - This film can serve as a guide for the new millennium killer: scouting locations using Airbnb, buying electronic key duplicators on Amazon, how to evade cameras, staging accidents, destroying evidence, etc. And only David Fincher could make such a clichÃ©d narrative mesmerizing to watch, with clean editing and top-notch audiovisuals. Watching an actor with OCD play a killer with OCD offers a truly immersive cinematic experience. ðŸ«° "Stick to the plan, be well-prepared, don't improvise, and trust no one."
