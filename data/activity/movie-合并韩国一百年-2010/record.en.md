This is a quite representative NHK production, with all aspects of its production being exquisite. The innovative visual effects are unsurprisingly seamless, befitting a nation known for its attention to detail. The music by Takashi Kako is beautiful. After watching, one can generally grasp the perspective of Japanese society on the historical context of Japan-Korea relations, serving as a great supplement to historical details. One strong impression is that the film strives to interpret history from a neutral and fair perspective, yet it inevitably views it from a self-centric lens. Therefore, as the film progresses towards the exploration of modern relationships, it loses the compelling engagement that the beginning has.
