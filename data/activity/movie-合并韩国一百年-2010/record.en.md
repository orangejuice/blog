A representative work from NHK with exquisite production on all fronts. Innovative visual effects are not out of place, reflecting a nation that pays attention to details. The music by Kago Ryunosuke is beautiful. After watching, one can generally understand the context of Japan-Korea relations as perceived by contemporary Japanese society - a good supplement to historical details. One heavily sensed aspect is that the film strives to interpret history from a neutral and fair perspective, but it can't escape its ego-centric perspective. Hence, the unfolding of events towards the end, and the handling of modern relations, were not as captivating as the beginning.
