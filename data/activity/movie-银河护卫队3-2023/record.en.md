Not a Marvel fan, do not believe in superheroes. The plot is freely played with no logic to speak of, the creation and propulsion of the story rely on a madman with a pathological mentality in control. Unable to establish trust and immersion on a reasonable basis, the result is no way to empathize, making some emotional scenes extremely deliberate and unnatural. In general, it's like a product that maximizes pleasing the audience's preferences, without a trace of various elements put together. Yet, it has earned rave reviews, discussions, attention, and wealth.
