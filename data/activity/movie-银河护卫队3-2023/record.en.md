I'm not a Marvel fan, I don't believe in superheroes. The plot is wildly improvised, devoid of any logic, and the story is driven by a madman with a pathological mind who holds all the power. Unable to establish a foundation of rationality, itâ€™s impossible to build trust or immersion, making the emotional scenes feel very forced and unnatural. Overall, it is a product that seems maximally designed to pander to audience preferences, arbitrarily combining various elements without a trace. Nonetheless, it has earned significant acclaim, discussion, attention, and wealth.
