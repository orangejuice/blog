Quite primitive, silent movie with dubbed voice, the shaky footage is frightening. The recording equipment is decent, close-up shots of characters look particularly good. Both sound effects and visuals are poor; its historical value exceeds its artistic value. That’s all there is. As for the plot, what struck me was the genuine portrayal of poverty, the shocking moments of true loss, which made me really sympathize with the loss…
