It's quite primitive with silent film dubbing, and the jittery images are scary. The video equipment is decent, the close-ups of the characters are especially good-looking. The sound and picture quality are too poor, historical value surpasses artistic value. There isn't much else to say. As for the plot, what leaves a deep impression on me is, they are truly poor, when they are horrified, they genuinely let go of their possessions, it makes me feel sorry for their things...
