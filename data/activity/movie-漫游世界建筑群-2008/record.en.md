I only watched episodes 1 and 3, which focus on Chinese architecture, presenting more like a travelogueâ€”not cursory or random. The Chinese streets at that time were distinctively vibrant, amidst extensive construction and flying dust, with the crowd in naive, curious, and shy traditional attire. The contrast of bright reds, greens, blues with the lingering old street scenes creates a nostalgic blend, like hearing a spoon scrape a pot. Every view brings a sense of emotion. It was my first encounter with the Hanging Temple, and hearing that Taoism might have perished left me feeling lost and helpless. I believe that in the future, people will look back to the past to unearth the deeply buried springs of our ancestors to quench their own emptiness and thirst.
