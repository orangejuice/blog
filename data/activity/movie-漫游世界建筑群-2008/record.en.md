This time I only watched episodes 1 and 3 related to Chinese architecture. The style is more like a travel introduction, but not just a cursory overview. The streets in China at that time also had their distinct characteristics, witnessing massive construction, clouds of dust, and crowds of people in simple and naive clothing. Seeing the bright reds, greens, and blues juxtaposed with the old street view that still retains a trace of the ancient flavor, it's like hearing the scrape of spoon and bowl in a wok. I can't help but feel nostalgic every time I watch it. This was my first time hearing about the Hanging Temple, learning that Taoism might have already vanished made me feel desolate and helpless. I believe people in the future will look back on the past, and excavate some of the springs buried deep by our ancestors to quench their own emptiness and thirst.
