S1E3 “You can't know what it's like to be almost a god” / S1E7 Very boring / S1E9 “it’s hard to believe that a man could die of loneliness.” Doctor McAllen. “Not when you’ve sat in that room.“Caption Kirk./ S1E10 Very interesting encounter between species that don't trust each other. There is also a sense of tension when facing the cube.
