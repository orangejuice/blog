What's captivating is its uniqueness. A place not designed for pleasure, yet it attracts a constant stream of unique souls. Fiddling with instruments, recording, observing, and conducting scientific research at the ends of the Earth carries a certain romance. Here, far from the crowds, all who are met are of the same ilk. One wonders if the feelings experienced when encountering someone here are utterly different from those in the crowded cities. Here, when the sense of loneliness surges, one might imagine what theyâ€™d look like as a frozen corpse, inspected by themselves standing before it.
