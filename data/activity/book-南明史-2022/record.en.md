After reading Gu Cheng's monumental work "History of the Southern Ming", I initially thought that after the Jiashen year, the Southern Ming was forced into a corner, always weak, enduring defeats and fleeing. Reading this work, I realized there were several opportunities for resurgence. The author repeatedly mentions 'if only', making one feel the sorrow of their misfortune and the anger at their lack of resistance. The cover commentary by Beijing Daily Press states, 'Internal strife leads to the fall of a nation, yet even in ruin, the internal strife continues.'
