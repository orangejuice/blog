Via foresight news Shenfish, 'The Currency Pyramid' is a thin book, serving as an introductory text that can open up oneâ€™s thinking and broaden horizons, offering foresight into the future. The book mainly discusses the evolution of currency and frames a conceptual model on how cryptocurrencies will serve as a top-tier form of money, deriving credit money in the future. I personally agree with this perspective from the book and believe that it is the direction things are headed towards.
