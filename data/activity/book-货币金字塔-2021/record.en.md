Via Foresight News, 'The Money Pyramid.' This book is thin and is a popular science reading material that opens up thoughts and broadens horizons. It gives a prediction of the future. The book is mainly about the evolution of money, and a mental framework of how future cryptocurrencies as a top-level currency will derive credit money. I personally highly agree with this view in the book, I think the future is headed in this direction.
