The tension escalates with each installment, and by the third movie, it has rightly earned its title as a thriller. The convoluted backstory, intertwined with time travel to alter history, and straightforward horrors instead of just teasing scares, definitely show ambitions. The characters have matured slightly, and emotional scenes emerge subtly. When Harry hears his friends, his tense facial muscles immediately relax, and a smile appears at the corners of his eyes, while Hermione turns around and softly screams Harry's name joyously, capturing a truly beautiful moment.
