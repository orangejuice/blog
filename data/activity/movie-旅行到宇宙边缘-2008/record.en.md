The subject matter and visual production are excellent, but it doesn't achieve an effortless mastery. It's somewhat mysterious, with a disjointed plot and lacks directnessâ€”it feels very National Geographic-like in its strong pursuit of mystery and commercial style focused on visual effects. Details like the relative spatial positions of one planet to another, and where the Solar System is in relation to the galaxy, are all missing. The use of imperial units also greatly affects the direct impression of many figures. The attitude in scientific popularization should be humble, considerate of the audience, employing wonderful language, making appropriate use of tools, flowing coherently, and being engaging.
