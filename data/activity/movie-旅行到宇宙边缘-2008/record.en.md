The subject matter and visual production are very good, but they don't achieve a masterful level of execution, slightly pretending to be mysterious, disjointed in plot, lacking in intuition, it does have a distinct National Geographic Channel vibe, a potent pursuit of mystery and visual effect in their commercial style. The relative spatial position from one planet to another, the location of the solar system when viewing the Milky Way, these are all not communicated, even the use of British units greatly affects the intuitive impression of many figures. The attitude of science popularization should be humble, considerate of the audience, using wonderful language, appropriate utilization of tools, smooth and coherent, fascinating.
