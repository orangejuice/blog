Just at the end of the year, I unexpectedly started watching this work and couldn't stop. It's the best TV show I've seen this year. I haven't finished watching it yet, but the more I watch, the more fascinating it becomes, often touching and emotionally stirring. This is probably the charm of historical stories, the tear-jerking tales of heroes' downfall, and what's crucial is their truthfulness, something fictional works can't compare to. So many forgotten things are quietly waiting in the corners to be remembered again. Forgetting history is probably the root of many current problems, and in this sense, Teacher Yuan deserves the title of a great educator.
