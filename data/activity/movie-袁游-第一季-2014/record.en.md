Itâ€™s the end of the year, and I accidentally started watching this program and couldn't stop. It's the best show I've watched this year. I haven't finished it yet. The more I watch, the better it gets. It often touches me deep inside. This is the charm of historical storytelling, I guess. The moving stories of heroes reaching their ends. The most important thing is that it's real, something fictional works can't compare to. So many forgotten things are quietly waiting in corners to be remembered. Forgetting history may be the root cause of many problems today. In this sense, Teacher Yuan is a great educator and deserves this title.
