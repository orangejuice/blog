Via Tw Lewang, being parents requires learning and training, which could be achieved through self-training to become emotionally stable parents. Last night, I went to a friend's house and saw that two papers were taped on the wall next to the dining table. There were a few sentences printed in large fonts on each paper to remind themselves to manage their emotions. I think this method works well. Once again, I recommend this book that I read recently, 'I Wish My Parents Had Read This Book.'
