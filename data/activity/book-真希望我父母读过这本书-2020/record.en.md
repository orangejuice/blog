Via Twitter from Lewang, parenting requires learning and training. Becoming an emotionally stable parent can also be achieved through self-training. Last night, I went to a friend's house and saw two pieces of paper posted on the wall beside the dining table, each printed with large fonts reminding him to control his emotions. I think this method is quite effective. Recommending again this book I read a while ago, 'I Wish My Parents Had Read This Book'.
