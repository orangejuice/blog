Via Twitter from @Xu Lao Mao I once didn't quite understand why many foreign investment experts advocate for stoicism, until I saw this formula: Investment = 9% theory + 1% execution + 90% emotion management. This shows how important emotional management is to the success of investment. One's resilience and emotional control are no less important than macro judgement and accurate stock picking. The ancient Stoics are an excellent source of inspiration, and their practice can be directly applicable to our investing lives. 'Think Like a Roman Emperor' is a book that explains the ideas of Stoicism in an understandable way, and I have already added it to my reading list for this year. For investing and even for life broadly, Stoicism has about three main benefits: 1. It teaches us how to view setbacks. We should see setbacks as emotional training partners, not blame others or constantly blame ourselves. 2. It emphasizes the process and not the result. 3. It promotes a healthy and positive attitude towards life.
