Via Twitter from Xu Laomao, I once did not quite understand why so many overseas investment experts advocate Stoicism. After seeing this formula, I suddenly got it:
Investing = 9% theory + 1% execution + 90% emotional management
From this, we can see how important emotional management is in successful investing. One's resilience and ability to control emotions are as crucial as market trends analysis and precise stock picking. Ancient Stoicism serves as an excellent mental resource; their practices can be directly applied to our investment life.
'How to Think Like a Roman Emperor' is a popular book that elucidates Stoic philosophy. I have already added it to my reading list for this year. Stoicism broadly offers three values to investing and even life in general: 1, teaching how to view setbacksâ€”not seeing them as emotional adversaries but instead as training partners rather than blaming or self-reproaching continuously. 2, emphasizing the process over the outcome. 3, maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle attitude.
