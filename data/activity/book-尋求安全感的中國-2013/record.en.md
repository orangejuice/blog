Originally I was just killing time on the ride, reading Professor Lian You's 'Seeking Security in China.' The final chapter, analyzing three possible futures for China's development, piqued my interest. Then I found one of his speeches online, 'The Puzzle of China's Middle Class,' which nearly resolved all the confusion lurking in my mind from a few days ago when I was expressing my frustrations. It discussed the four differences and the four types within the Chinese middle class, with excerpts accordingly.
