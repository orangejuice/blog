Clich√© to the extreme, from not being trusted by their own people, to fighting against both allies and enemies, to gaining recognition from their own after defeating the enemy, a perfect example of cookie-cutter hero production. It makes no sense at all; take it seriously and you lose, you can only go along with whatever the writer decides. With so many prophecy orbs, Voldemort can't find them, but Harry and his friends just stumble upon them. And after finding them, they end up destroying the rest.
