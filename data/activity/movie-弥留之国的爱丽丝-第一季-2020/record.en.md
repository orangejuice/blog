Excellent mystery, quite innovative and combined with a uniquely Japanese cute yet silly charm, which sometimes becomes awkward but still manages to keep viewers watching. What's a bit exaggerated and outrageous is the motive behind this game - as if each mystery unraveled only reveals individuals' anti-social and psycho-killer tendencies. Then there's the huge live-action underground operations team, which gets wiped out? Nonetheless, this is a series that knows it's out to thrill. The male lead's spotlight is turned full-on, with much of the screen filled with torso, waist, thighs, and legs, and unapologetic killings with no regard for morals, law, and reason. This eyeball-driven entertainment might be thrilling, indeed, but the thrill is uncomfortable.
