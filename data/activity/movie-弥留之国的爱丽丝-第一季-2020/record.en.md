The mystery is excellent, quite innovative, and the Japanese cute and clumsy style can be awkward yet still very captivating, compelling one to binge-watch. What is more absurd is the underlying motive of this game, revealing one after another sociopally twisted individual descending into murderous madness? Also, there is a massive live-action underground operations team, and they get completely wiped out? Nonetheless, this piece accurately knows its identity as an exhilarating drama. The male lead commandeers all the spotlight with scenes filled to the brim with flashy displays of the torso, hips, legs, and wanton killing, disregarding morality, law, and reason. This type of sensationalism centered entertainment is thrilling indeed, but uncomfortably so.
