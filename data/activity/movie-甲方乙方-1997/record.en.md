A group of famous actors delivering authentically fantastical performances, alongside average passersby with awkwardly painful acting. The smoke never stops. The plot is nonsensically delicate, revealing a sense of meticulousness and serious self-expression from the creators. While it has the breath of real life and the actors genuinely strive in their performances, pushing the plot forward calmly, the story remains too unrealistic and lacks compelling views. It is only in the final shot that the long buildup finally unfolds, illuminating the inner conflicts and sadness of the cultured individuals.
