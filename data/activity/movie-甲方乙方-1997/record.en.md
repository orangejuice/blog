A group of famous actors are unbridled and imaginative, while the extras' acting skills are awkwardly embarrassing, the smoking scene never stops. The plot is absurd but also delicate, we can feel that the creators are seriously expressing themselves in their own way. Although it has a very humanistic aura, despite the fact that they are genuinely trying to act, despite the fact that the plot progresses calmly, the story is too unrealistic to hold much appeal. Not until the last shot, after ages of buildup, does it finally reveal its guts, intending to express the dilemmas and sorrows in the hearts of cultured people.
