Via Twitter, Xu Laomao is currently reading a very interesting and down-to-earth book about a foreign advertiser's account of Chinese consumers and markets during the Republican era. Carl Crow arrived in Shanghai in 1911 as a journalist and founded Crow Advertising Company in 1918 on the Bund, quickly establishing it as one of the top three advertising firms in Shanghai.
