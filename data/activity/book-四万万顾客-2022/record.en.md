Via tw Xu Laomao, I am currently reading a very interesting and grounded book: a foreign advertiser in the Republic of China describes Chinese consumers and the market. Carl Crow came to Shanghai as a journalist in 1911, and in 1918 he set up his own Crow Advertising Company in a foreign building on the Bund, becoming one of the top three advertising companies in Shanghai.
