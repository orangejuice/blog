      comment: Read the first chapter in the light reflected from the windowsill. Also
        coming in through the window were the tire noises from the road and the
        screams of various birds.

      comment: The writing is too beautiful and too tragic, too powerful and too
        effortless. This text is filled with blood and tears, it's the dimming
        and falling of a brilliantly shining, beautiful soul. I would compare it
        to classical literature, being mentally controlled and tormented to the
        point of madness and suicide, the only difference being that it happens
        in the context of the wealthy class in modern society. I am convinced in
        my heart that this is an incredibly kind and pure, highly sensitive and
        talented master. She was originally humble, outstanding in personality
        and ability. But in this systematically oppressive environment where
        right and wrong are inverted, she exhausted her young and shallow
        spiritual strength and life. The stench of this world, covered by the
        perfume of pretentious people, the incomprehensible pain of girls curled
        up in corners, trapped on the dark side of the world with no escape, far
        from people and in extreme loneliness, the norm of putting on a brave
        face and deceiving oneself that happiness means keeping a smile - all of
        this is vividly portrayed before me, making me feel as if I've
        experienced it personally, feeling greatly familiar. The entire
        atmosphere makes me feel a comfort as if my soul is being caressed,
        feeling not alone in finding a kindred spirit also tormented by the pain
        of existence. Kindness, love, weakness, and powerlessness are
        intertwined. One must be kind, but even more so, one must become
        strong!!
