---

A cast of famous characters appear, Feng Gong has a profound foundation in comedy and plays his part really well, depicting a reliable and humane elder brother who takes care of his siblings in all aspects. The film has a strong sense of the reality from the turn of the century, rooted in the lower class and reality, touching on the bitterness of poverty, the separations and reunions of the world, and the trifles of the family. The fading in and out of scenes adds a touch of drama elegance. A bit bewildering though is that, as a movie from 1998, it seems a decade ahead in terms of family changes and development progress from the perspective of a child growing up in a small city.
