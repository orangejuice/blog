  subtitle: 1998 / Mainland China / Comedy / Yang Yazhou / Feng Gong, Ding Jiali
---

A host of famous actors appear, with Feng Gong showing his deep comedic skills from his roots in crosstalk, also proving to be quite an actor, a responsible and empathetic elder brother accommodating to all his younger siblings. The film has a cross-century realism, rooted in the grassroots and reality, touching on the bitterness of poverty, the separations and reunions of life, and the mundane intricacies of family life. The subtle transitions in scenes add a touch of dramatic refinement. What's a bit bewildering is that this 1998 movie, from the perspective of a child who grew up in a small tenth-tier city, seems to portray family changes and progressions that are a decade ahead of its time.
