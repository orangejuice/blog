I don't like this kind of absurd comedic film style, but this one somehow carries more of a taste of real society and the human spirit than seemingly serious works, with its magic, sadness, and contradictions. Society is advancing day by day, brought about by people, but also manipulated by them. Survival or destruction, it's hard to understand.
