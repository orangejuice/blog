I’m not fond of this nonsensical and chaotic style of film, yet this one, seemingly without a coherent theme, brings a more potent taste of social realities and humanistic spirit. It’s magical, sorrowful, contradictory. Society moves forward day by day, driven by people, yet also manipulated by them. Survival or destruction, it's baffling.
