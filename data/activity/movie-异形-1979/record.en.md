Revisited the childhood shadows on November 19, 2022. Astounded by the absurd behavior of the characters in the movie, which was stupid and illogical to the point of laughter. The story is driven by foolishness and impulsiveness, setting a bad precedent for half a century, even a century, of science fiction movies. Other aspects might be okay; not being thrilling enough is my issue, I have grown old, rigid, and boring. Not like when I was young, I was truly engrossed, emotionally involved in every scene, utterly captivating. Can that feeling ever be recaptured?
