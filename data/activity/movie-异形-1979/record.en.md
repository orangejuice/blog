Revisited this childhood nightmare on 19th Nov 2022. Astonished by the ridiculous actions of the characters in the film, they are so stupid and illogical that it's laughable. The development of the story is driven by stupidity and impulsiveness, which unfortunately set a bad precedent for the sci-fi movies of the latter half of the century, even the entire century. Other aspects should be acceptable, it's my problem if it doesn't feel enough, I am getting old, rigid, and boring. It's not like when I was younger, I was so immersed and captivated by every scene. Can't I regain that feeling anymore?
