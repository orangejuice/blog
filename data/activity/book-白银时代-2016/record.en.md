Whether true or false, the reading enchants with underlying cryptic currents, leaving one in a wistful haze. The mastery of language is profound, playing with words wantonly. On the surface, it shows respect but is filled with rebellion and disobedience, distinctly characteristic. The overt expression of 'sexuality' is like a huge slogan plastered on the forehead: non-compliance. Excerpt 1: Once everything 'begins', there is nothing terrifying left in this world. Right now, I'm just a bit afraid of dying. After death, there will be no fear. Excerpt 2: Humans dwell all over the world, living in a daze, eating then sleeping, and after sufficient rest, eating again. Later, people gathered in river valleys and plains, established civilizations, and from there, all troubles began.
