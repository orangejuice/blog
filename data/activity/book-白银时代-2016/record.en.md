The reading is surreal and ambiguous, with coded messages that can confuse the reader. The language foundation is deeply profound, wildly playing with words, seemingly respectful on the surface, yet full of rebellious non-compliance, showing a great personality. The 'explicitness' of sex is like a big banner on the forehead: Disobedience. Excerpt 1: Once everything has 'started', there is nothing scary in this world. I'm just a little scared of death right now. After I die, I won't be afraid anymore. Excerpt 2: Humans are scattered around the world, living a hazy life of eating and sleeping. Later, people gathered to live in some river valleys and plains, and civilization came forth, and all troubles arose from this.
