A well-produced blood-soaked gangster movie with impeccable acting and a great script. Remarkable scenes in the warehouse and elevator. I was stunned for a second by the logic that any data leak immediately signals an undercover presence, showing how the era of big data with no privacy has just begun. The internet era will render some professions obsolete, including spies and undercover agents. Ding Qing's transcendent, life-defying love for Lee Ja-sung shines amid the chaos, a ray of light in the bloodshed... The seemingly final turn to darkness by the handsome Lee Ja-sung, was he actually a gangster-turned-cop who then infiltrated the gang again??
