This is a well-made crime movie soaked in blood, with impeccable performances and a good script. The sequences in the warehouse and the elevator are stunning. The logic that the leakage of information immediately determines the presence of an undercover agent stunned me for two seconds, it turns out, the era of big data without privacy is something that just happened recently. The internet age will cause a group of people to lose their jobs, including spies and undercovers. The love of Ding Qing for Li Zicheng, which transcends the worldly and life itself, has become a ray of sunshine amid bloody violence. It seems that at the end, Li Zicheng, the handsome devil, in fact, came from a gang, became a policeman, and then infiltrated the gang again?
