This work, contemplated as being 'self-directional', gives children a sense of empowerment. Understand the need to let go and let children learn to solve their own problems. 'Self-driven Growth' deeply inspires with this quote - 'The feeling of 'being in control' is a prerequisite for a healthy psyche. It's the source for proactive progress. It's the motivation to get back up after a fall because it's driven by personal desire, not because of being forced to become someone. Only after learning to let go, giving the choice to children, allowing them to solve their own problems, allowing them to make their own decisions, allowing them to take responsibility can they really feel their sense of control and empowerment. Truly confident children are the ones who have the right to choose.'
