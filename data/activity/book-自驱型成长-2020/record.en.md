Through the perspective of lower beings, the book empowers children. ðŸ“– Learning to let go, letting children learn to solve problems on their own. 'Self-Driven Growth' is deeply inspiring with its message: This sense of autonomy is the foundation for a healthy mindset, the source of proactive progression, and the motivation to get up after a fall because of personal desire, not because of being forced to be a certain way.

Only by letting go, granting children the right to self-determination, and allowing them to learn to solve their own problems, can they truly feel in control and empowered. A genuinely confident child is one who possesses this right to choose for themselves.
