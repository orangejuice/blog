The acting is quite commendable. Ignore the logical loopholes and the movie comes off as relaxed and fun. It's about an underwear design company, a handsome male department head, and a beautiful female colleague with sexual innuendos galore. The male lead uses a magical weapon to win over his desired female co-worker. This aspect is quite intriguing. Actually, this magic weapon is just a packaged aphrodisiac which only allowed him to sleep with his female colleague, but didn't make her fall for him. Only after satisfying his physical desires and thus gaining some confidence, he starts expressing his love through his actions, eventually winning over his female colleague's heart.
