The acting is quite engaging; if you don't fuss over the logic, the movie is quite relaxing and fun to watch. Set in a lingerie design company, featuring a handsome male department head and a beautiful female colleague, the sexual innuendos are plentiful. The male lead uses a "magical weapon" to win over his desired female colleague, which is quite an interesting point. This "magical weapon" is essentially just repackaged aphrodisiac, used to sleep with his colleague rather than make her fall in love with him. Only after fulfilling his physical desires and gaining some confidence, he begins to take actions towards love, eventually winning his colleague's heart.
