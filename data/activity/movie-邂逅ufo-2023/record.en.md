Overly cumbersome and subjective, with cheap visual effects. The deliberately manufactured scene reproductions would have been better left out, turning potentially interesting topics into something dull. The final episode starts with Japanese culture in an attempt to elevate the theme through a Japanese follower of an extreme alien cult, who claims to be an alien himself, trying to convince us to collectively await an alien who will assist humanity towards a peaceful future?? Disregarding logic and scientific rigor, it presents some new perspectives amid absurdities, causing the overall persuasiveness of the film to plummet. It's not a serious documentary but a sensationalist tale.
