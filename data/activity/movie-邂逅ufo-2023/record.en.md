Overly subjective and tedious, with cheap visual effects. The deliberately created reenactment scenes were unnecessary and made interesting matters uninteresting. The final episode, which attempted to elevate the theme through the lens of Japanese culture, featured an extremist Japanese alien cult member who claimed to be an alien trying to convince us to anticipate an alien who would help humanity and promote a peaceful future with humans. The documentary discarded logic and scientific nature, presenting several absurd new perspectives, which greatly undermined the persuasiveness of the film. It is not a serious documentary, but a whimsical tale.
