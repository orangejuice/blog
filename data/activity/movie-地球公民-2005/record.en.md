This kind of thinking, this ability to confront oneself and face issues, is one of the rare bright spots of humanity. Just look at how humans treat animals, and it's clear how they will treat their own kind. I really wish there were countless films like this, ones that calmly and factually confront issues directly — shouldn’t they be countless given the multitude of issues surrounding us? Takeout, factories, kitchens, slaughterhouses, farms, logging sites, and so on — this seemingly glamorous society has too many black boxes that should be given more attention, forcing them to open up and take responsibility.
