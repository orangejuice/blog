This kind of introspection, this ability to face oneself and the problems directly, is one of the few bright spots of humanity. How humans treat animals sheds light on how they treat themselves. I really hope that there are countless films like this. These cool-headed and realistic films that confront issues directly should be countless. Aren't the problems around us as numerous as the hairs on a cow? Takeout food, factories, kitchens, slaughterhouses, farms, logging sites, etc. There are too many black boxes in this seemingly shiny society. We should pay more attention to these black boxes, let them open their doors, and take up their responsibilities.
