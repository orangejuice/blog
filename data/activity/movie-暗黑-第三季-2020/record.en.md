Mystery dramas have a natural draw that keeps viewers watching until the end, especially when they incorporate elements of time travel, multiple universes, and chaotic sexual ethics. The series revolves around love, pleasing the general audience and providing a seemingly conclusive explanation - that love is the ultimate reason, with no need for further explanation. After spending several days watching this show, my feelings were more of disappointment than anticipation. The occasional structural echoes and introduction of new concepts provided momentary pleasant surprises. On one hand, the dialogue and actions of the characters were pretentious and theatrical, lacking soul. The few repetitive characters, upon meeting, fall in love immediately, with even fewer extras. The cast seemed more like Non-player characters (NPCs) on a five-square-meter stage, walking gracefully through an exquisite script. Their universe suspended in midair, with no other tasks or existence of any other world. On the other hand, the acting was very stiff. Hearing the feeble shouts of 'Why are you doing this', 'Where are you taking me', and the repeatedly cryptic and profound philosophical phrases gave me a headache.
