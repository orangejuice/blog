Mysteries inherently draw viewers to watch until the very end, especially with elements like time travel, multiple universes, and convoluted sexual ethics. Anchoring the narrative with romance appeals to the mainstream audience and justifies itself—love is the ultimate reason, with no need for further explanation. After several days, I finally finished this series, but my feelings are more of disappointment than anticipation. The occasional structural echoes and introductions of new concepts only provide small surprises. On one hand, the characters' dialogue and actions are overly contrived and scripted, lacking soul, involving just a few recurring individuals, with men and women destined to fall in love at every meeting, and hardly any extras—characters more like NPCs on a tightly scripted 5-meter stage, suspended in midair with no other missions or worlds existing. On the other hand, the acting is desperately lacking, often marred by weak exhortations like 'Why do you have to do this?' and 'Where are you taking me?', along with repeatedly pondering the 'profound mysteries' filled with enigmatic philosophies, which is quite frustrating.
