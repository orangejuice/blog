From Via tw morris' movie review of 'Togo': Though restrained, it still made me cry. It is adapted from a true story, warm but powerful. The sled dog Togo was born with an illegitimate bloodline and suffered from illness, yet he had a strong will that led him to accomplish extraordinary feats. He proved himself over ten years, completed a miracle in twelve years, and lived a legendary life in sixteen years. The film has a dual narrative structure. It alternates between the present and flashbacks to shape the experience of Togo. It depicts his mission of transporting life-saving serum over 425 kilometers of treacherous journey. Despite being twelve years old, Togo braved snowstorms, avalanches, and river crossings, and journeyed through mountains and severe cold with his owner. His tenacity and bravery were earth-shattering. His courage to move forward without looking back, and his loyalty and faith exceed human imagination. Disney depicted Togo's intelligence and wisdom in a heroic light. The doghouse, the fields, the snowstorms, and the cliffs were where Togo grappled with his natural instincts and where he attempted to conquer. Throughout his life, he was always trying to break free from the shackles of fate, even though honor had been forcibly taken from him...
