Some parts are not translated well enough, and some parts have been cut off. The book is a good one. Its points summarize the noisy world of today very well, and some of its accents are very necessary even though they seem common sense at first sight. Unfortunately, I have been reading it for half a month and havenâ€™t finished it yet, eventually running out of patience, and I've skipped a lot of content. This book should be read by the public, but its cumbersome nature deters the general audience. It's dry to read, but the main reason for that is me. I am too impatient. Why does it feel like a luxury to sit down and read a book, adds to the biggest sorrow of the present times.
