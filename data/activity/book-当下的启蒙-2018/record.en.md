Some parts were not translated well, and some sections were cut. The book is good, and its arguments effectively summarize the noisy world today, emphasizing what seems like common sense is very necessary. Unfortunately, after reading for a month and a half, I still hadn't finished, no longer having enough patience to continue and skipping many parts. This book should be read by the general public, but its sheer size has already alienated them. Reading it was tedious, but this is mainly my fault for being too impatient. Why settling down to read this book has become a luxury, represents the greatest sadness of our times.
