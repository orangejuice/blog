  title: The WEIRDest People in the World
  subtitle: Joseph Henrich / 2020 / Farrar, Straus and Giroux
  intro: >-
    Perhaps you are WEIRD: raised in a society that is Western, Educated,
    Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. If so, you’re rather psychologically
    peculiar.

    Unlike much of the world today, and most people who have ever lived, WEIRD
    people are highly individualistic, self-obsessed, control-oriented,
    nonconformist, and analytical. They focus on themselves—their attributes,
    accomplishments, and aspirations—over their relationships and social roles.
    How did WEIRD populations become so psychologically distinct? What role did
    these psychological differences play in the industrial revolution and the
    global expansion of Europe during the last few centuries?

    In The WEIRDest People in the World, Joseph Henrich draws on cutting-edge
    research in anthropology, psychology, economics, and evolutionary biology to
    explore these questions and more. He illuminates the origins and evolution
    of family structures, marriage, and religion, and the profound impact these
    cultural transformations had on human psychology. Mapping these shifts
    through ancient history and late antiquity, Henrich reveals that the most
    fundamental institutions of kinship and marriage changed dramatically under
    pressure from the Roman Catholic Church. It was these changes that gave rise
    to the WEIRD psychology that would coevolve with impersonal markets,
    occupational specialization, and free competition—laying the foundation for
    the modern world.

    Provocative and engaging in both its broad scope and its surprising details,
    The WEIRDest People in the World explores how culture, institutions, and
    psychology shape one another, and explains what this means for both our most
    personal sense of who we are as individuals and also the large-scale social,
    political, and economic forces that drive human history.

Via tw indigo 哈佛大学人类演化生理学教授 Joseph Henrich 的这本《The WEIRDest People in the World：西方如何变得心理特异并且特别繁荣》给出了他的解释！

从全球的视角再看西方人，你会发现西方是个特例，也许应该说其它地区的人都是“正常”的，而西方人是“不正常”的。据此 Henrich 发明了一个后来被广泛引用的词，叫 “WEIRD”，这个词既有“怪异”的意思，又是西方怪人的五个特征的缩写
