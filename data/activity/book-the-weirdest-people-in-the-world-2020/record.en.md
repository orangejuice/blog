Via tw indigo Professor Joseph Henrich from Harvard University, in his book 'The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous', provides his explanation!

Looking at Westerners from a global perspective, you will find that the West is an exception, perhaps it should be said that people from other regions are 'normal,' and Westerners are 'abnormal.' Based on this, Henrich coined a term that has been widely cited called 'WEIRD,' which means 'strange' as well as an acronym for the five distinctive features of Western eccentrics.
