Professor Joseph Henrich from Harvard University presents his explanation in this book, 'The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous'. 

From a global perspective, when you look at the West, you'll find that the West is unique. Perhaps we should say that people from other regions are 'normal', and Westerners are 'abnormal'. From this, Henrich has coined a term that has been widely quoted: 'WEIRD', which not only means 'strange', but also is an abbreviation for the five characteristics of weird Westerners.
