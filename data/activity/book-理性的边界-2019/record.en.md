The translation is orthodox, the author is quite thoughtful. After reading the author's introduction, he seems to come from a strong background. The language in many places is rigorous and academic, yet there are places that are movingly described. However, the work does not consistently engage the reader on the topic. It's not a perfect read, but still decent for understanding these concepts.
