The translation is passable; the author seems quite thoughtful. After looking at the author's bio which reveals a strong background, the language often feels academic, like a scholarly paper, yet some descriptions are very moving. However, it does not maintain a consistent standard to captivate the readers on the topic. It's not a perfect book but fairly good for understanding these concepts.
