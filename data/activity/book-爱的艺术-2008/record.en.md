Via friends reading list / via tw @PeaDee The most important thing is to learn to be alone without reading books, listening to the radio, smoking, or drinking. The ability to concentrate is manifested in being able to be alone— and this ability is a prerequisite for learning to love. Because we cannot support ourselves, we can only tie ourselves to another person who might be my life's savior, but this kind of relationship has nothing to do with love. — Fromm, The Art of Loving
