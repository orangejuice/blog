Via friends reading list / via tw Beanlet: The most important thing is to learn to be alone, and not to read books, listen to the radio, smoke or drink. Whether or not you have the ability to concentrate manifests in whether you can be alone - and this ability is also a prerequisite for learning to love. Because we cannot be self-reliant, we can only connect ourselves with another person, who may be the savior of my life, but this relationship has nothing to do with love. --Fromm &lt;The Art of Loving&gt;
