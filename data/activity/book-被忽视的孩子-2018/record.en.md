I highly agree with the problem of emotional neglect raised in this book, which leaves a black hole in the sun's place in our hearts. Golden words: Only emotion and connection bring meaning to the strange thing we call 'being alive'. Emptiness and numbness kill the joy of life, and it is cruel for parents to not fulfill their roles for innocent children. However, children who receive adequate appropriate nurturing, bask in sunshine, bathe in love, are full of emotion, have the ability to love, and attract love from others - how can one not be envious? The translation is very poor, lacking in fluency and appeal that touches people, making this book hard to read, contemplating giving up on reading the English version...
