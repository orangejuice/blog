I strongly agree with the emotional neglect issues raised in this book, as it plants a black hole in the place in the heart where the sun should be. A wise saying: Only emotions and connections bring meaning to the strange thing we call 'living.' Emptiness and numbness kill the joy of life, and it is cruel for parents not to properly fulfill their roles, impacting innocent children for their entire lives. In contrast, children who are appropriately nurtured enjoy the sunshine, are bathed in love, full of emotions, and their capacity to love also attracts love from others, making them enviable. The translation is poor, lacking the fluency and emotional impact that would make the book easy to read, which makes it difficult to get through. This makes me want to lazily give up and read the English version instead...
