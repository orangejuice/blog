Via tw Mengsheng Sometimes, a lot of so-called 'love' is in the form of 'seclusion'. I recently thought of this novel by Eileen Chang again. Two bored individuals, due to fate, cohabitate for a prolonged period, and just happen to have a little in common, thereby quickly generating so-called 'love'. But when the bell rings, the tram starts moving, only then you realize these 'friendly sentiments' were just a dream, and you have to return to the lonely 'life track'.
