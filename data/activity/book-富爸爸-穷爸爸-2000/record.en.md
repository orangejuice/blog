Via Twitter user Lu Erchen, there is a classic excerpt in 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' featuring a conversation between a teenager Robert Kiyosaki and his Rich Dad in the 1960s related to the essence of money, and the impending severance of the dollar from the gold standard (occurred in 1971) and its massive impact on the future middle class and poor individuals. Rich Dad continued, 'Rich people understand that money is an illusion, like a carrot hanging in front of a donkey. Fear and greed have countless people clutching onto this illusion, thinking it to be real. It's not. Money is created, and trust in this illusion, along with ignorance, cause people to enact a multitude of plans that cannot stand up to scrutiny.' He mentioned that the US was operating under the gold standard then, with each dollar corresponding to a specific weight of gold. He was very interested in the rumors that the US was going to abandon the gold standard and that the dollar would no longer be tied to gold. 'If something like this happens, kids, the gates of Hell will open soon. The lives of the poor, the middle class, and the ignorant will be destroyed, since they believe that money is real wealth, and they trust that the companies they serve or the government will guarantee their livelihood.'
