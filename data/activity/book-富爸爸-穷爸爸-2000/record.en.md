Via Twitter Lu Erchen: There's a classic segment in 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' where a teenage Robert Kiyosaki in the 1960s has a conversation with Rich Dad about the nature of money and the imminent impact of the dollar going off the gold standard (1971) on the future middle class and the poor: 

Rich Dad continued, 'The rich know that money is an illusion, much like the carrot dangling in front of a donkey. Fear and greed cause countless people to cling to this illusion, mistaking it for reality. It's not. Money is made up, and trusting in this illusion along with ignorance leads people to make unsustainable plans.'

He spoke about how the United States was on the gold standard at that time, with every dollar backed by a certain weight of gold. He was very interested in rumors that the U.S. was going to abandon the gold standard and that the dollar would no longer be linked to gold.
"If such a thing really happens, children, the gates of hell will soon open. The lives of the poor, the middle-class, and the ignorant will be destroyed because they believe money is real wealth and that the corporations or governments they work for will secure their livelihood."
