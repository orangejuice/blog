  title: The Dawn of Everything
  subtitle: David Graeber David Wengrow 大卫·格雷伯 / 2021 / Farrar, Straus and Giroux
  intro: >-
    A trailblazing account of human history, challenging our most fundamental
    assumptions about social evolution--from the development of agriculture and
    cities to the emergence of the state, political violence, and social
    inequality--and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation.

    For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and
    childlike--either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike.
    Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those
    original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David
    Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the
    eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of
    European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting
    this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human
    history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities,
    democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.

    Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the
    authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn
    to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what's really there. If
    humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of
    hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and
    cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds
    of social and economic organization did they lead to? What was really
    happening during the periods that we usually describe as the emergence of
    the state? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of
    human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful
    possibilities, than we tend to assume.

    The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the
    human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways
    of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual
    range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of
    direct action.

    Includes Black-and-White Illustrations
