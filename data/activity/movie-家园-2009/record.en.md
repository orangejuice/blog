Some text and numbers are very impactful, but the imagery does not always align with the text, making irrelevant photography stretches too long, slackening the rhythm, causing the viewer to lose focus, unable to stay immersed in the sadness. As a documentary advocating for environmental protection, it's a bit disappointing that it couldn't control the narrative pace. It's hard to say that watching this film will trigger the emotions it wants to express. As a nature documentary, it falls short of other films. Of course, when mankind leaves Earth, each frame of record about Earth will be priceless.
