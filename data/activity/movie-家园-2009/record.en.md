Some numbers and texts are impactful, yet the visuals don't always match the content, leading to overextended presentations of irrelevant photographic material, dragging the pace, causing viewers to lose interest and struggle to stay immersed in the somber mood. As an environmental advocacy documentary, it is disappointing that it fails to control the narrative pace, and it's hard to say whether one would feel the intended emotions after watching it. As a natural scenery film, it also falls short compared to other documentaries. Of course, once humanity leaves Earth, every frame documenting it will be a priceless treasure.
