Via Twitter, LeWang shared that the family watched the 1996 movie 'Fly Away Home' together last night. This old film is a touching parent-child movie, which felt great to watch with the kids. The scenes flying alongside the geese were amazing. The plot is simple and the design somewhat obvious, but it clearly showcases the differences in intimate family relationships between Chinese and North America (USA and Canada).
