Via tw lewang, the whole family watched the movie 'Fly Away Home' together this evening. This old film is a touching parent-child film that is great to watch with children. The filming effect of flying with the geese is very good. The storyline is simple and the design is quite obvious, but you can clearly feel the difference between the intimacy of Chinese and American-Canadian families.
