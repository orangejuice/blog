  title: A Way of Being
  subtitle: Carl R. Rogers / 1980 / Houghton Mifflin
  intro: A Way of Being was written in the early 1980s, near the end of
    Rogers'  career, and serves as a coda to his classic On Becoming a
    Person.  More philosophical than his earlier writings, it traces his
    professional and personal development.  Rogers concludes by predicting a
    more humane future.
