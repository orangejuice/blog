Via Twitter @yangpigui: The 2016 Slovenian documentary 'Liberation Day', directed by Ugis Olte and Morten Traavik. In 2015, North Korea celebrated the 70th anniversary of its liberation by inviting the infamous Slovenian fascist band Laibach to perform in Pyongyang. The event was filled with censorship and compromise, institutional and aesthetic conflicts, making it a fascinating spectacle. This is a case where reality is indeed stranger than fiction.
