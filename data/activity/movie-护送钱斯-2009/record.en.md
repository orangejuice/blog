Via Twitter, Zoe shared a film that is as simple as it gets yet deeply moving - 'Taking Chance.' It reflects the deep reverence many Americans hold for the lives of fallen soldiers. This story circulated online and was initially made into a documentary in 2008, which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary. In 2009, it was remade and nominated for the Best Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The film lacks a grand narrative or heroic oaths, maintaining a tone of solemnity, dignity, and emotion throughout. Without overt sentimentality, every ceremonial aspect commands respect. Lifeâ€™s passing is quickly forgotten, yet it never truly disappears, especially for these genuine soldiers who embraced their role in life, an exemplary soldier. As if still alive as long as there is movement! Quietly experiencing this film allows one to genuinely appreciate the reverence for life, the human touch, during its 70-minute runtime.
