Discouraged after one episode. The acting, characters, and plot are too rigid, with the creation of characters and development that are disconnected from reality, coupled with the addition of supernatural eerie elements. It self-proclaims to be thrilling, but in reality, it adds on three parts of stupidity. Is such an immature script and crew trying to discuss this poignant topic? Reserving comments. Which planet does this outdated cool beauty warrior skin version of police robot Nano come from? This play seems to be more like implementing a consumerism that everything can be used for attention-grabbing, creating a fast-moving consumer goods idea by smoking marijuana, and the indiscriminate bombing that tries to provoke audiences' nerves and hormones. It's a pitiful human spectacle. I can't enjoy this kind of doomsday-style pretentiousness.
