A single episode is disheartening. The acting, characters, and plot are too rigid, with unrealistic character development driven by supernatural eerie elements that pretend to be thrilling but actually add an element of foolishness. How can such an immature script and crew attempt to discuss this tragic subject? I reserve my opinion. This Nanon seems like a dated, aloof "pretty girl warrior" type, a skin-covered cop robot from another planet. The film's underlying tone seems to embrace a consumerism that uses everything to attract attention, creating a commercial, disposable product while high on cannabis, bluntly bombarding the audience in an attempt to stir their nerves and hormones. It's sad for humanity. I can't enjoy this kind of apocalyptic, contrived madness.
