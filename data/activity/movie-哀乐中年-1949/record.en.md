Via tw gretadino, I watched this movie from 1949, 'The Mournful Middle Age', which has a 9.3 rating on Douban. The female protagonist says things clearer and more sensibly than many people today, such as 'Chinese are a strange nation, treating death as so significant yet not caring how to live well during their lifetime', 'Chinese only have youth and old age, there is no middle age'â€¦
The highest upvoted comment in the review section states, 'The advancement of technology has misled us into thinking that the era is also progressing.'
