Via tw gretadino just watched this 1949 movie 'Sorrow and Joy in Midlife' the other day, rated 9.3 on Douban. The words of the female lead are more wakeful and insightful than many people nowadays. She said things like, 'Chinese people are a strange race, they care so much about death, but do not care how to live well when they are alive' and 'Chinese people only have youth and old age, no middle age'. The highest praised comment in the film's comment section is, 'The advancement of technology makes us mistakenly believe that the times are also progressing.'
