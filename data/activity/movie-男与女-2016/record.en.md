via tg arya 2023-11-29 / via tw Mickey_M 'Man and Woman' rated 8.1 on Douban. It's the best portrayal of adult male-female relationships I've seen in recent years. It's about extramarital affairs. I like the title 'Man and Woman' because it doesn't take a stance or make judgmental observations. The bed scene between Jeon Do-yeon and Gong Yoo may not display the most sophisticated techniques, but it's one of the best I've seen so far. It gracefully portrays the relentless desire and mutual respect between them, and is beautifully filmed. 2024-1-22
