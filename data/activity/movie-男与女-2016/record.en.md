via tg arya 2023-11-29 / via tw Mickey_M 'A Man and A Woman' scored an 8.1 on Douban. It's one of the best films I've seen in recent years that portrays the relationship between adult men and women, dealing with extramarital affairs. I like the title 'A Man and A Woman' for not having any directional viewpoint or partisanship. Jeon Do-yeon and Gong Yoo's bed scene is one of the finest I have seen; not to say it's the highest level of performance technique but it's definitely among the top ones I've seen. What's vivid is their intertwined desires, cherishing and respecting each other, portrayed in a very, very beautiful and skillful manner. 2023-1-22
