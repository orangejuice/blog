This story of the last royal brother's family, set against an unfamiliar yet true backdrop, is imbued with a fully legendary character. The leading lady, with her soft gaze and crescent eyebrows, looks absolutely stunning in various costumes throughout the film. The story is mild, like still water. Aside from the unnatural Mandarin pronunciation by the Japanese actors, the tragic yet powerless love of the royal family amidst wartime influences and moves deeply.
