The story of the last imperial brother's family is strange and real, with a strong sense of legend. The lead actress is stunningly beautiful in various costumes in the film. The story is quite gentle, besides the unnatural Chinese pronunciation of the Japanese actors, the helpless, tragic love of the last imperial family under the sway of war is still moving.
