As commented by Ethan on Twitter, “Their cognition is commensurate with the suffering they endure.” This perspective from high above is saturated with strong Stoicism, which believes that pain originates from cognition. By adjusting cognition and aligning it with “virtue”, one can attain happiness. However, Kant has long stated that virtue and happiness are fundamentally two different entities. Reducing the problem to individuals’ varying cognition would ultimately lead to apathy. At the opposite extreme of apathy is indiscriminate sentimentality, a principless and unconditional sympathy for so-called “weaker” groups. Such unchecked sympathy will eventually dissolve morality and reduce the solution to purely animalistic emotional impulses. In reality, a mistake made by the weak is still a mistake, and whether they deserves to be saved is irrelevant to this, it’s not only the perfect victims deserve to be saved. Both glorifying the morality of the victims and overly emphasizing the moral issues of the victims will only blur the focus. The key to maintaining a balance between apathy and indiscriminate sentimentality is to be rational. This book divvies life into three stages: childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.
