via Twitter Ethan 'Their cognition is commensurate with the suffering they endure.' This condescending perspective carries a strong Stoic hue, which believes that pain stems from perception. By adjusting perception to align with 'virtue,' one can attain happiness. However, Kant has long argued that virtue and happiness are fundamentally different things. Reducing the issue to each person's inevitably varying 'perception' will only lead to indifference. The extreme opposite of indifference is sentimentality, an unprincipled, unconditional sympathy for the so-called 'weak.' Allowing such sympathy ultimately erodes morals and solves problems through purely animalistic emotional impulses. In truth, the failings of the weak are still failings, and their right to be saved is independent of this, as you don't need to be a perfect victim to deserve salvation. Glamorizing a victim's morals, or overly emphasizing their moral problems, only blurs the focus. To maintain a balance between indifference and sentimentality, the key is rationality. This book divides life into three modes: childhood, youth, and adulthood.
