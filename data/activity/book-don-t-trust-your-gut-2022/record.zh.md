  title: Don't Trust Your Gut
  subtitle: Seth Stephens-Davidowitz / 2022
  intro: >-
    n Don’t Trust Your Gut, economist, former Google data scientist, and New
    York Times bestselling author Seth Stephens-Davidowitz reveals just how
    wrong we really are when it comes to improving our own lives. In the past
    decade, scholars have mined enormous datasets to find remarkable new
    approaches to life’s biggest self-help puzzles. Data from hundreds of
    thousands of dating profiles have revealed surprising successful strategies
    to get a date; data from hundreds of millions of tax records have uncovered
    the best places to raise children; data from millions of career trajectories
    have found previously unknown reasons why some rise to the top.

    Telling fascinating, unexpected stories with these numbers and the latest
    big data research, Stephens-Davidowitz exposes that, while we often think we
    know how to better ourselves, the numbers disagree. Hard facts and figures
    consistently contradict our instincts and demonstrate self-help that
    actually works—whether it involves the best time in life to start a business
    or how happy it actually makes us to skip a friend’s birthday party for a
    night of Netflix on the couch. From the boring careers that produce the most
    wealth, to the old-school, data-backed relationship advice so well-worn it’s
    become a literal joke, he unearths the startling conclusions that the right
    data can teach us about who we are and what will make our lives better
