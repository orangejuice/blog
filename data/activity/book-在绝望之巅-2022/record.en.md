Via tw drinking29, it's rare for me to want to read books, thinking about seeing what geniuses write, so I took a book 'At the Summit of Despair' for a while. “In this world where one should not feel regret for anything, there's a lot that can cause regret. But I ask myself: Is this world worthy of my regret?” Well, it does have that flavor. Emil Michel Cioran, pronounced as 'Qiao Long' in Pekingese dialect.
