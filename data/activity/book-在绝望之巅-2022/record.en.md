Via Twitter @drinking29: Rarely do I feel like reading a book, thinking about seeing how a genius writes, and I picked up 'At the Summit of Despair' for a while. 'In this world where one should not regret anything, there are many things that can make one regretful. But I ask myself: Does this world deserve my regret?' Wow, it really has that flavor. Ã‰mile Michel Zi Ollong, as we say in Beijing, 'knocking melodiously'.
