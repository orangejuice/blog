Strickland was uniquely unique, so unique that he was a character straight out of a novel. The text blends the author's sensitivity and restlessness, as well as his inner melancholy, analysis of human nature, and liberating philosophical reflections, all carried with a strong autonomy. Some understandings of human nature did indeed attract me.
