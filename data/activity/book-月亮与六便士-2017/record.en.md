Strickland is too unique, unique enough to be a character in a novel. The author's sensitivity and 'restlessness', as well as the author's inner melancholy, analysis of human nature, and straightforward philosophical thoughts are blended into the text, showing a strong autonomy. Some understanding of human nature did attract me indeed.
