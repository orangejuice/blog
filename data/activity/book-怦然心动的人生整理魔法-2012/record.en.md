Via Twitter @oldwhite If your dorm is always a mess, and your bedroom gets cluttered again less than a week after cleaning, then you must check out this book. Books about decluttering are commonly known, such as 'Goodbye, Things,' which I have also read, but I still recommend Marie Kondo's book more. The reason for recommending this book lies in that it includes a magical method that allows you to tidy up once and keep it clean forever, eliminating the need for a second round. I read it two years by and applied its method once, maintaining its cleanliness to this day without it becoming messy again. I still remember when I first decluttered, throwing away nine large bags of trash, and I was really surprised by how much unnecessary stuff a small bedroom can hold. Right after tidying up, I sat in front of a clean desk, feeling the refreshing evening breeze on my face, and felt as if a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, feeling incredibly relaxed and comfortable. This feeling is truly incomparable, and I encourage you all to try it. Looking forward to your feedback.
