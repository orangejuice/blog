As shared by an old reader from Taiwan, if your dormitory is always messy, and your bedroom gets cluttered again within a week of tidying, then you must read this book. The book about decluttering that most people might be familiar with is 'Goodbye, Things', which I have read, but I still recommend Kondo's more. The reason for recommending this book is that it introduces a magical method that allows you to tidy up once, and maintain cleanliness without having to tidy up again. I read it two years ago, and after using the method from the book to tidy up once, it has remained clean ever since, never getting messy again. I remember when I tidied up, I threw away nine large bags of garbage. I was really surprised that so many unused items were hidden in my little room. The night after I finished tidying up, I sat at the clean desk, feeling the refreshing evening breeze on my face. The weight on my body seemed to be unloaded, making me feel particularly relaxed and comfortable. This feeling is truly incomparable and worth a try, I look forward to your feedback.
