An excellent portrayal of small officialdom in China at the turn of the century. Each character is vividly brought to life. In a solemn courtyard under the cold city walls, a ceaseless unofficial war transpires without the sound of gunfire. The mighty eaves of the house coldly observe the comings and goings of people, creating a sense of an iron camp with flowing soldiers. Power is like a wise servant with infinite fighting power -- it is at the disposal of those who control it, to be wielded at their will. People use it to obtain everything they want. The things they fight for and the power itself seem to be ethereal and elusive, always unattainable, and even once obtained, they are not forever. Yet, they are also concrete. Without it, there is humiliation and poverty; with it, everything goes smoothly and as one wishes.
