An excellent portrayal of petty officialdom in China around the turn of the century. Characters leap vividly off the page. In a solemn courtyard beneath the cold city walls, there unfolds a continuous, smokeless battle of wits. The imposing eaves coldly watch the comings and goings, evoking the essence of iron camps with flowing troops. Power, like a wise servant with endless combat capability, is at the disposal of its master, wielded at will. People use it to gain everything they desire. The objects of this struggle, like power itself, seem intangible and unattainable; even once obtained, they are not held forever. Yet they are specific. Without it, there is only humiliation and destitution; with it, everything goes smoothly and as desired.
