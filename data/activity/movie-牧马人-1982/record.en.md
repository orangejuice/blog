This movie is amazing. One of the best films I've seen. The artistic techniques, story implications, dialogues, and characters are all fantastic; the emotional depth is delicate, and the direction is top-notch. My goodness, this is what true patriotic education films are all about. A must-watch in life. Thank you to the crew for leaving us with these wonderful memories of that era.
