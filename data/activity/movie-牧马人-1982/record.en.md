This film is fantastic. It's one of the most enjoyable movies. The craft of art, the innuendo of the story, dialogue, and characters are all excellent, with nuanced emotions. The director nailed it. My goodness, this is a genuine patriotic educational film. It's a must-see in life. Thanks to the team for leaving us this fantastic era memory.
