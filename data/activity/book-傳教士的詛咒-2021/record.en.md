Through Twitter, Ding Bu'er shared another work about Catholicism that has recently been translated into Chinese. This is 'The Missionary's Curse: A Global History of a North China Village (1640â€“2000)', written by Henrietta Harrison. She is a historian who studies church history. She also writes about the grassroots Catholics in North China, their perception of Catholicism under the overarching concept of revolution and the forgotten common believers.
