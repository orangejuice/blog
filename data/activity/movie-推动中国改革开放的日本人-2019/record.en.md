This is my second time watching it, just added to Douban, turns out it's a film from 2019. Japanese know how to tell a story gently. Their sincerity is quite moving. The content is captivating, it's a good historical lesson. I am also thankful for the work of the subtitle team. Perhaps taking a detour is inevitable, all I can do is silently hope that this society improves sooner.
