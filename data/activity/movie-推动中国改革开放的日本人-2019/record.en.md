Watching it for the second time, added to Douban, turns out it's a 2019 film. Japanese can tell a story so gently, it's truly moving with genuine emotions, the content is fascinating and great for historical enlightenment. Also, thanks to the subtitle team. It seems that taking detours is inevitable, can only silently wish for this society to get better soon.
