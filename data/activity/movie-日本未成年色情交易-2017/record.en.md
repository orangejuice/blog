The reporter is really unbearable, Douban's evaluation of her is very accurate. Her condescending attitude and disgusted expressions are very annoying, do reporters not need to verify credentials? Is this person qualified? This is the first time BBC has disappointed me. Nonetheless, I finished watching, just to have a bit more understanding of this phenomenon also affecting netizens at home and abroad.
