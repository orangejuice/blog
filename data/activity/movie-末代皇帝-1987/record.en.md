A 1987 film that reflects the dramatic historical changes of a whole century. Its greatest weakness is the poor treatment of language. The English soundtrack is not good, but the Chinese track is worse, and the subtitles do not correspond to the Chinese voiceover, which makes it awkward to watch. However, the content and scenes are excellent. The faded old wallpapers convey a sense of decay. Key historical events and moments are presented through the eyes of the last emperor. Although there are some dramatized parts, the film fortunately avoids clich√©s, and still tugs at one's heartstrings, giving one a taste of helpless bitterness. 2021.10.24 / Last recorded 2019/8/8
