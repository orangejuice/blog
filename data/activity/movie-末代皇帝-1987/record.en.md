The 1987 movie reflects the dramatic historical shifts of an entire century. Its biggest weakness is poor language handling, with ineffective English audio tracks and even cruder Chinese tracks; subtitles and Chinese voiceovers do not match, making it awkward to watch. However, the content and scenes are excellent, with fading old walls conveying a sense of decay. With major incidents and historical moments seen through the eyes of the last emperor, though dramatized, it luckily avoids clich√©s and still manages to be compelling, leaving a bittersweet taste.
