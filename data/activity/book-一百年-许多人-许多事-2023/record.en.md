Via tw Stopped Cloud, I finished it in two days. A detailed personal history with succinct, candid, bright and calm narrative, countless ups and downs of ordinary people's lives (ordinary here does not mean the real sense, but that they are common people in her eyes). As Yu Bin said, this 'is part of the overall atmosphere of an era.'
