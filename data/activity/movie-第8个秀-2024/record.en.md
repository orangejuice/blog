A bad film pieced together with various elements, yet it's not entirely terrible due to its brutal depiction of social realities. The several twists in the middle are quite eye-catching. I watched it to pass the time and ease my mood, but the horrifying human nature portrayed made me feel heavy. For instance, the 8th floor watching with pleasure the lower floors being tied up, stripped, and tortured, indulging in the dual pleasures of power and sex. And we, the audience in front of the screen, unburdened psychologically, watching cheap but powerful borderline entertainment and appreciating the performances of beings stripped of their societal masks by visible and invisible forces, struggling to survive, revealing their primal instincts and desires, all the while satisfying our own desires, reaping the rewards of dopamine and adrenaline.
