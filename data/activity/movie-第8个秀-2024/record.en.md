A sloppy movie patched together from various elements but not entirely abysmal due to its harsh, unsparing depiction of societal realities. The multiple twists along the way are somewhat eye-catching. It serves well to pass time and vent, yet the depiction of terrifying human nature weighs heavy on me. For instance, a scene depicts an individual on the 8th floor masturbating while watching those on lower floors bound, deprived, and enduring agony to enjoy the dual pleasure of power and sexuality. Meanwhile, the audience, unburdened with guilt, indulges in this border-skirting entertainment, relishing performances that strip societal facades to reveal raw biological instincts and desires under the invisible yet tangible forces of oppression and struggle for survival, satisfying their own cravings and reaping the rewards of dopamine and adrenaline.
