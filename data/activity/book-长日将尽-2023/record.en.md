Via Twitter Beanlet: When a person indulges persistently and incessantly in a certain thought over a period of time, it's common to encounter this kind of problem where the involved person is lost in confusion; it is only through a rather unexpected event triggered by an external incident that they suddenly come to realize the true nature of things.
— Kazuo Ishiguro, 'The Remains of the Day'
