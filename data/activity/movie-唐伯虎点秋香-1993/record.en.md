I forgot whether I watched it when I was younger, but I revisited it with great anticipation. The exaggerated, fantastical style is somewhat uncomfortable to watch. It's not the brilliance of the plot that makes me laugh, but the absurdity and departure from reality that bring about a bizarre feeling and the subsequent awkward self-mockery. Some shots do display some imagination and artistic obsession, but it’s not the cinematic effect I was looking for. Maybe this artistic style just doesn’t mesh well with me. I hope I haven't become a boring, annoying adult who has lost the infinite imagination of a child. Better to stop watching, and not let it continuously bother me.
