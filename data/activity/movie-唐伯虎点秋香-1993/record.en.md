I forgot whether I watched it when I was a kid, so I revisited it with high anticipation. The extravagant magic realism made me quite uncomfortable. What I found funny was not the clever plot, but the absurd and out-of-reality expression that gave me a weird, eccentric feeling and the accompanying awkward self-mockery. Some shots did have some imagination and artistic obsession in them, but these were not the film effects that I wanted. Maybe this artistic style doesn't match my own. I hope I haven't become a vulgar, uninteresting, detestable adult who has lost childlike limitless imagination. I decided not to keep watching and let it constantly knock on myself.
