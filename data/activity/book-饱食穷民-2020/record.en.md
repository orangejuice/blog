The author's sensitive and careful writing touches me deeply, showing profound conversational skills and keen observation. The subtly pervasive sense of reality is striking. Additionally, the conclusive discussions in the epilogue are continuously fascinating, making for a deeply moving read. It is truly a qualified documentary work.
