It's long, but remarkably good to the point it doesn't feel boring. The movie vividly presents a society that existed before the advent of modern civilization, with underlying self-interests, survival of the fittest and pure, unblemished love. People by nature are risk-taking animals in pursuit of maximum benefits, with virtue and other noble qualities coming afterwards. When the benefits of doing something outweigh the risks, there is always someone willing to have a go. The uncle epitomizes pure evil, the nephew is torn between right and wrong, and Molly represents absolute purity. Molly's innocent demeanor and her expansive heart signify a type of beautification and light in the movie, offering some comfort to the audience.
