Lengthy, yet surprisingly good, it never feels dull throughout. It vividly portrays the dark and jungle-like society before modern civilization, revealing the calculative human nature, the survival of the fittest among groups, and the ever-relevant theme of pure, unblemished love. People are creatures willing to take risks and maximize self-interest, where so-called morals and other noble virtues come secondary. When the benefits of an action outweigh the risks, there will always be someone willing to attempt it. The uncle represents pure darkness, the nephew sways between dark and light, and Molly is pure innocence. Ms. Molly's harmless nature and broad generosity serve as an embellishment, a beam of light in the film, offering some solace to the audience.
