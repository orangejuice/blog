Boring to the point of tears. The storyline is a clich√©d and melodramatic tale of a hero and a damsel, wrapped in a simplistic package of American-style grand justice versus evil Nazis. Only some of the visual effects are worth mentioning. It's uneventful and intellectually undemanding, suitable for children over the age of one.
