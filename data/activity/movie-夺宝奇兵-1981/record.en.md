So boring, I cried from boredom. It's just a very clich√©d story of a hero and a beauty, simply packaged in the notion of American greatness and the fight against evil Nazis. Some visual effects are worth mentioning though. It's so uneventful and mentally undemanding that it's suitable for anyone over the age of one.
