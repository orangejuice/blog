The storyline is filled with fluff, and the pacing is incredibly slow; the acting and dialogue are stiff and insincere, and the logic is naive and mindless â€” it was shot to entertain elderly people during summer nights. Despite its stable quality, without rush or extravagant elements, it is far from as good as imagined.
