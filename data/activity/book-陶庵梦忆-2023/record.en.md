Via Twitter user 停云 'Because I think of my life, glamorous and dazzling, but all is fleeting, everything in the past fifty years, all is but a dream.' Each time I re-read 'Dreams from Taoan', the same feeling of regret and dismal from the illusory dream still affects me. Zhang Dai was born in Jiangnan, a place filled with blooming flowers and willows, a family of poetry, rites and scholars, a land of gentle richness. In his youth, he was flamboyant and unruly. In his middle years, he experienced a national catastrophe, tasting the warmth and cold of the world. In his old age, all his friends and old acquaintances had passed away, a myriad of thoughts turned into ashes, he only owed himself a death. His written words, are rich with infinite sorrow and loneliness. If tasted slowly, it adds more worry. People often say that those who are frustrated look up to Taoan, and it is indeed not without reason.
