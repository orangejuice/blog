Via Twitter 停云 'Thinking of my past life, the glamour and beauty, all fleeting before my eyes, fifty years have all turned into a dream.' Every time I reread 'Tao'an’s Dream Reminiscences', that sense of a dream within a dream remains infectious. Born in the thriving pleasure quarters of Jiangnan, to a family of scholarly traditions and genteel affluence, his youth was spent in lavish debauchery. Midlife brought national turmoil, experiencing life's harshness. In his older years, relatives and old friends were gone, many having passed on to the underworld, leaving him in utter desolation, only death was owed. His writing contains boundless melancholy, a closer taste only adds to the sorrow. It's said not without reason that those frustrated in life should read Tao'an.
