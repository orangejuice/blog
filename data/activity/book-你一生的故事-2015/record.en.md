Among the works I've read so far, I recommend the novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee, Ted Chiang's short story collection 'The Story of Your Life', and Orwell's '1984'. Recommended in poetry dramas is the sole god: Goethe's 'Faust' and 'The Ring of the Nibelung'. Recommended sociology works include Professor Ruskin's introductory comparative politics work 'The Concept of the Nation' and Lazarsfeld's seminal work in communication studies, 'The People's Choice'.
