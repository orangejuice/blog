via tw white light: Among the works I have read, I recommend Harper Lee's novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and Ted Chiang's short-story collection 'Story of Your Life'. I also recommend Orwell's '1984'. For poetry and drama, I recommend Goethe's 'Faust' and 'The Ring of the Nibelung'. In terms of sociological texts, I suggest Professor Ruskin's introductory comparative politics book 'Concept of the State' and Lazarsfeld's mass communication masterpiece 'People's Choice'.
