    Review

    "Mechner's journals are a unique record from the birth of an industry, in
    the words of one of its pioneers--and if that's all they were, they would be
    invaluable. But The Making of Prince of Persia is also an unvarnished window
    into the creative process, with all its excitement, toil, setbacks, doubts
    and triumphs. A fantastic read." --D.B. Weiss, writer and co-creator of
    HBO's Game of Thrones

    "When an industry is brand-new, its innovators are generally so busy
    creating the future that they rarely have time to document the present.
    Luckily, Jordan Mechner did. With these journals, we can track the
    development of Prince of Persia from a few penciled squiggles to a global
    franchise. For anyone aspiring to create a game--or any endeavor that takes
    months and man-hours--Jordan's journal is sobering and inspiring." --John
    August, screenwriter, author, host of Scriptnotes podcast

    "Mechner's journals are a time machine that takes us back to an era when
    ambitious young creators were making strange new video games all by
    themselves and making up the rules as they went. It is not a retrospective;
    instead, it is a present-tense diary written by the creator throughout the
    creation of his most influential work. It is a humbling and inspiring record
    of what it was like to make one of the best video games of all time. I love
    these journals." --Adam "Atomic" Saltsman, game designer and creator of
    Canabalt

    "Prince of Persia was the first computer game I ever fell in love with.
    Thirty years on, we are very lucky to have this window into its creative
    process. Mechner's journey is a universal one for anyone creating something
    brand new, and it brought me back to the early, crazy days of building
    Instagram. The engineer in me loved his description of the technical
    challenges and solutions, and the entrepreneur in me loved the honest
    chronicle of his emotional adventure. I'm excited to get to revisit these
    journals in newly illustrated form." —Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram

    "Probably my favorite book on game development." ––Neil Druckmann, writer
    and director of The Last of Us and Uncharted 4
