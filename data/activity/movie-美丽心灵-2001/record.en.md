This is a successfully visualized biographical film in which schizophrenia plays a significant role, providing decisive room for the plot to unfold. Ending the narrative with love is fitting. The passionate proclamation 'you are all the reasons' was received without guilt by the lady, who had to make unimaginable efforts to live with this madman for half of her life. This love, like talent, cannot be sought only found. The leading man's acting skills are good. The meticulous depiction of the characters' makeup and facial expressions was a bit distracting, pulling the viewer out of the story. It's hard to sympathize with the world of genius.
