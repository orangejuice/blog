The film adaptation of the biography was very successful; schizophrenia played a significant role, allowing the plot to be explored decisively. Ending with a love story was quite appropriate, with the poignant confession 'you are all the reasons' rightfully accepted by the lady, who has unimaginably endured living with 'the madman' for half a lifetime. Like genius, such love is rare and serendipitous. The lead actor's performance was outstanding. The detailed artistry in makeup was so intense that it sometimes broke the immersion, making it hard to sympathize with the world of the genius.
