An inspiring tale of female growth, quintessentially American at its core, lined with beautifully natural prose-poetry. It's a story of budding maturity, interactions between people and the land, the freedom and its costs—pristine beauty, simultaneously romantic and deadly. The tender discourse and the intricacy of the narrative captivated me profoundly. Exploring the unknown wilderness, a luxury not afforded to those now lost. Modern cities, safe from natural threats, come at the cost of losing an environment that nurtures on-the-ground growth and exploration, bravery, and lessons from nature's rules. The vast wilderness sharpens focus on the essence, where good and evil coexist. Numerous scenes breathed with me, "Every person on Earth must endure great pains until they become the pain of another." "When you love someone, you exchange souls; they hold a piece of yours, and you hold a piece of theirs." "When your beloved dies, a piece of your soul dies too, but theirs remains within you." "The earth is God." "One thing about trouble—it remains trouble as time passes." "Goodbye, my friend." "Whatever she fell in love with, she wouldn't hesitate to let the world see it."
