A movie about the growth of an ambitious woman, with a very American core and beautiful, natural prose poetry. The awakening of sentiments, the interaction between humans and the land, the freedom and the cost of freedom, pristinely beautiful, romantically fatal. The tender emotions expressed and the exquisite narrative have utterly fascinated me. To explore the unknown nature is the luxury of those who have passed. The cost of a secure and peaceful modern city free from natural threats is the loss of an environment for immersive growth, and the associated exploration of the unknown, brave performances, and education and baptism under natural rules. The vast wilderness focuses you on the essence, where good and evil coexist. Countless scenes breathe with me, 'Everyone on earth will experience countless pains until they become the pain of others.' 'When you love someone, you trade souls with them, having a piece of theirs and they of yours.' 'When your love dies, a piece of your soul dies with them, but their piece of your soul is still in you.' 'Earth is God' 'One characteristic of trouble is that it remains trouble as time goes by.' 'Goodbye, my friend.' 'What she loves, she would unhesitatingly let the world see.'
