Extremely characteristic of its era. It clearly presents the artistic creation goals in a collective living environment: aligning with societal demands, educating and guiding the populace, promoting socialist values and the work ethic advocated by the state, nearly devoid of entertainment for its own sake, but infused with humor to fulfill a mission. The magic lies in how a potentially tedious educational propaganda film, becomes vividly entertaining through the portrayal by the department's 'comrades,' each protagonist as lively as real people. The nuanced micro-expressions of Ge Ling are so rich and fitting that it feels like watching a documentary. The patriotism and professional dedication of the actors are clearly visible, as is their joy in enlightening the masses and dedicating themselves to society with heartfelt sincerity. The rich emotions and complex spiritual states depicted in the drama are not entirely clear to me, but they are undoubtedly era-defining, inspiring awe. While watching, one cannot help but think of it as the 'Chinese version of The Office.'
