The movie is characterized by a distinctive sense of time. It clearly presents the artistic creation goals in a group living environment: To meet social demands, to educate and guide the people, to promote socialist values and the national work ethic, it is almost devoid of entertainment for the sake of entertainment, instead it is filled with humor for the sake of fulfilling missions. The magic is that the bland propaganda and educational films are made lively and interesting by the comrades from the editorial department. Each protagonist is as vibrant as a real person, and the rich and fitting micro-expressions of Ge Ling seem to be watching a documentary. It highlights the patriotism and devotion of the actors, their willingness to enlighten the masses, and the joy of contributing to society, all with sheer sincerity. The rich emotions and complex spirit state displayed in the play make it hard for me to distinguish, but it is full of its time's characteristics and makes me sigh. While watching the play, I sometimes think of it as the 'Chinese version of The Office'.
