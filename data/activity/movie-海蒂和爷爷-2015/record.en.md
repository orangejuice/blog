Unexpectedly made it to the Top 65. Although it's not bad, it didn't feel as good as expected, perhaps my expectations were too high. It's very sunny, beautiful, happy, and able to embrace everything, but the villains with bad intentions are unintentionally suppressed by the clever and kind protagonist, which feels a bit familiar and cliche. Perhaps it's a children-oriented work, Heidi will become the best and most healing friend of every child. If taken as a childrenâ€™s film, it scores full marks.
