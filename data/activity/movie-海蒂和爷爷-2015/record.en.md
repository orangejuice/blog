Surprisingly in the TOP 65. Although not bad, I didn't think it was this good, perhaps my expectations were too high. It is very sunny, beautiful, and blissful, able to embrace everything, but the villains with ill intents are unwittingly suppressed by the clever and kind protagonist, only able to stew in frustration — somewhat familiar and somewhat cliché. Perhaps it's a children's film, after all, Heidi could become every child's best and most healing friend. As a children's movie, it deserves full marks.
