Fans of 'The Merchant and the Alchemistâ€™s Gate' and 'Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom' will enjoy this. It discusses time travel and free will. The translation is poor, the diction is contrived, and the language used does not align with Chinese colloquialisms. If you have time, read it in English.
