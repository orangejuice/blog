Via Twitter user Tingyun: I like a quote from 'The Willpower Instinct': 'There is no perpetual peak nor eternal trough, true strength isnâ€™t forgetting but accepting, accepting the impermanence of life, accepting loneliness and frustration, accepting sudden feelings of powerlessness, accepting one's own imperfections, and accepting the anxiety and regret of confusion and insecurity.'
