Via tw Stop Cloud, I like a quote from 'Willpower': 'There is no permanent peak nor eternal abyss. True strength is not to forget but to accept, accept the impermanence of things, accept loneliness and defeat, accept the sudden feeling of powerlessness, accept one's imperfections, and accept the anxiousness and regret of confusion.'
