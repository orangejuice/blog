Within exactly a month, I have finished catching up with the youthful memories of our old friends. It's also the 30th anniversary of Friends. As time goes by, classic works like this possess the power to penetrate through time and space, striking the heart directly. This series portrays advanced progressive concepts, equal and mature emotions, close relationships while maintaining boundaries, and diversified preferences yet with understanding and respect. Youth lights up like fireworks, sexuality and affection are both looked straight in the eye and pursued, filled with romance, embodying the universal beautiful sentiments and ideals of humanity. It merges with the new millennium context, seemingly leading us to a future filled with sunlight, hope, and opportunities. The various hardships will be lightly resolved with humor and mutual support, just move forward freely, everything is possible (NYTimes: 'Friends' is always a fantasy, an embellishment of urban life. The characters in the series live in palatial, spacious apartments, enjoying inexhaustible leisure time). It not only creates everyone’s ideal friends in their hearts but also fulfills each person’s hidden beautiful wishes. It's warm and appealing.
