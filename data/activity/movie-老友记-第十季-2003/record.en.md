In just one month's time, I followed the youth memories of the old friends. It also coincidentally marks the 30th anniversary of Friends. As times change, classic works possess the power to transcend time and space, striking deep into the heart. This show exhibits progressive and advanced concepts, mature and equal emotions, intimacy with maintained boundaries, and varying quirks that nonetheless encourage understanding and respect. Youth bursts like fireworks, sex and emotions are both acknowledged and pursued, capturing the utmost romance, embodying universal human sentiments and ideals, blending seamlessly with the turn of the new millennium. It feels as if the future is filled with sun, hope, and opportunities, with difficulties and challenges eased by humor and mutual support, pushing forward freely where anything is possible (NYTimes: Friends is always a fantasy, it embellishes city life where characters reside in palatial apartments, enjoying inexhaustible leisure time). It not only constructs the old friends in everyone’s heart but also realizes everyone’s deepest desires. It's warmly enticing.
