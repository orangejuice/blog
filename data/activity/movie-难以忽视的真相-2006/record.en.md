A must-watch documentary of the 21st century due to the severity of the issue it addresses. The film is far from dull and is quite persuasive. In this era, it is not easy to perform, as one needs facts, confidence, the courage to face the public, and exceptional performance skills. The protagonist is also a very interesting person.
