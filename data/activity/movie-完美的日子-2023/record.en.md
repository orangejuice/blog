The uncle is taciturn and autistic, fond of watching the play of leaves' shadows through sunlight (a beautiful Japanese term: Komorebi), watering seedlings, reading extensively, and listening to Japanese and English songs. He maintains a minimalist circle of life, content with his small world. He experiences the ruthlessness of life and nature, as frost and challenges sculpt and force one to submit, eventually becoming a quirky old man who seeks self-consistency. In this world, loneliness is often imposed; people prefer to hide in crowds, maintaining easy friendships, exchanging mundane details, socializing and shopping, creating lively atmospheres, and laughing heartily around a table.
