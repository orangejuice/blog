The uncle is withdrawn and quiet, enjoying the observation of dancing leaf shadows (a beautiful Japanese term: Komorebi), nurturing seedlings and watering them, reading widely, listening to Japanese and English songs, and maintaining a minimalist daily life, satisfied with his little world. We can sense the ruthlessness of life and nature, the wind, frost, knives, and swords that shape and mold people's contours, forcing you to surrender to them, eventually turning you into an obstinate white-haired old man seeking self-consistency. The loneliness in this world is mostly imposed, people would rather hide in crowds, maintain some easy-going friends, talk about daily affairs, gatherings, shopping, creating merriment, and laughing around the table.
