Via tw Lao Bai, I read the book 'Intimate Relationships' a year ago during the summer vacation. The author is a psychology professor at the University of Houston, who has been awarded the Outstanding Research Award by the American Psychological Association, and is widely recognized as a leading figure in the field of psychology. Every page I read refreshed my perceptions (I had been deeply influenced by bestselling books before), and after finishing, I gained a whole new perspective. All my confusion about effective communication between people, how to flirt with men, how to have healthy arguments, how to survive the so-called 'seven-year itch', and other issues related to intimate relationships, were answered most accurately. I now carry this book with me wherever I go, even though it's quite heavy, haha.
