Via Twitter, Lao Bai: I read this book 'Intimate Relationships' last summer. The author is a psychology professor at the University of Houston and has received the Outstanding Research Award from the American Psychological Association. He is widely recognized as a leading figure in the field of psychology.

Each page I read completely reshaped my worldview (previously spoiled by bestsellers), and after finishing it, I felt enlightened. It answered all my questions about intimate relationships, including how to communicate effectively, how to flirt, how to argue properly, how to overcome the seven-year itch, and more.

Now, I carry this book everywhere, even though it's quite heavy haha.
