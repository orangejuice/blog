Via Twitter: Dou Xiaodou says, 'It is in various states of being that play, and only play, enables a person to reach perfection and simultaneously develop their dual nature... One is truly human only when one plays; and one is fully human only when one plays.' â€”Friedrich Schiller, 'Aesthetic Letters'
