As extracted from a Weibo post by user Dou Xiao Dou, 'In all various states of mankind, it is through games, only games, that can perfect humans and help develop their dual nature... The human only plays when he is, in the true sense, a human; and it is only when the human is playing, he becomes a complete human.' â€” Schiller, 'Letters Upon The Aesthetic Education of Man'
