via tw @morgan Just by looking at the era and concepts, the author's ideas are very insightful. For women, gender equality seems like a concept that is always right but problematic in practice. What women need is the recognition and promotion of female values, not to become like men, or to allow society to let women use the male discourse system, judging or selecting women based on patriarchal social standards.
