In the moment when civilization before and civilization collides, a legendary parable unfolds, revealing the mysterious veil of primitive civilization, shattering the beautiful imagination of primitive life. The visual effects are extraordinary, immersing you in the jungle world to fight alongside the protagonist, as if the next moment will be a brutal slaughter. It can't help but make people sigh at why life, the process from building civilization to stepping out of primitiveness to our society today is inexplicably beyond comprehension.
