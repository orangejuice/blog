In the fleeting moment of civilization meeting pre-civilization, a legendary allegorical tale unveils the mysteries of primitive cultures and shatters the idyllic views of primitive life. The visual effects are outstanding, immersing the audience in a jungle world fighting side by side with the protagonist, as if the next moment might bring brutal slaughter. It makes one marvel at the purpose of life, contemplating how far the journey from establishing civilization and emerging from the primitive has brought us to our modern society, surpassing understanding and imagination.
