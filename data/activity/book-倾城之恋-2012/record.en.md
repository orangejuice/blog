      comment: "Via Twitter from Huangpu Memories: 'Old friends don't know my current
        situation; new acquaintances don't know my past. Current situations
        should not be known by old friends, and the past should not be told to
        new acquaintances. No matter how many people you meet, you'll find no
        one quite like me.'"

Via Twitter from Huangpu Memories: 'Old friends don't know my current situation; new acquaintances don't know my past. Current situations should not be known by old friends, and the past should not be told to new acquaintances. No matter how many people you meet, you'll find no one quite like me.' / via Twitter from Little Bean: 'The lines I often think of and find the sadliest are: "Physical pleasure is fleeting; joy of the heart soon turns to sorrow; only the pleasure of reason stays with us till the end."'
