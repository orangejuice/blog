      comment: "Via Twitter Huangpu Memory: The old do not know my current situation,
        the new do not know my past. The current situation should not be known
        to the old, the past should not be told to the new. Even if you meet
        many people, there is no one quite like me."

Via Twitter Huangpu Memory: The old do not know my current situation, the new do not know my past. The current situation should not be known to the old, the past should not be told to the new. No matter how many people you meet, there is no one quite like me. / via Twitter Dou Xiaodou: What I think of most often, and consider the saddest phrases are: 'The pleasure of the flesh is temporary; the pleasure of the heart is bound to turn into sorrow; only the pleasure of the mind is with us forever, until the end.'
