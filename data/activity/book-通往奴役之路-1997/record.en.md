via tw @morris Elon Musk said, if I could only take one book to Mars, it would be Hayek's 'The Road to Serfdom'. Hayek once said, we must admit that a world where the rich are powerful is much better than a world where one must be powerful to be rich. Beneath interests, one sees character; beneath right and wrong, one sees the law; beneath power and lust, one sees morality; in times of peril, one sees relationships. There are two things in the world one should not look directly at: the sun and the human heart; the former damages the eyes, the latter breaks the heart.
