Dull, boring, and self-indulgent. As another version of myself became evident, it kicked off with whimsical fantasies. There's little logical causality, advancing the plot whimsically, creating fake romance and encounters. It attempts to stimulate the senses with some faded horror film colors, beautiful faces, exposed bodies, and unappealing sensuality, making it seem even cheaper.
