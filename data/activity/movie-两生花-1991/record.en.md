Boring, dull, and self-indulgent. The casual appearance of another me starts a soliloquy. There's no causality, the plot advances whimsically, creating false romance and encounter. It attempts to stimulate senses with faded horror film colors, beautiful faces, exposed bodies, and unattractive sexual desire, making it seem even cheaper.
