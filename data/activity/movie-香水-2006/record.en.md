1. The climax was so shocking. The camera spoken volumes, shedding tears with the protagonist, almost as if appreciating the beauty of art. 2. It's the first time that perfectionism seems so terrifying, the pursuit of perfection by the flawed character is chilling. 3. Laura is such a beautiful name, when you hear it, it's like smelling perfume. I don't understand why in this movie this name feels so magical. Of course, it has something to do with the gorgeous female lead, like a bright, pure flower blooming from the fetid mire. 4. Life without love is so barren, twisted, and pitiful. The terrible things they did cannot be blamed on him! He's done so much, even he doesn't realize it, he just wants to be loved. Why can't he be loved, why must he be forgotten and ignored all his life? 5. I didn't expect this film, which is ranked 218th, to be so outstanding. I must read the original novel.
