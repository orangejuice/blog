1. The climax is too stunning, the camera conveys a thousand words, crying with the protagonist like rain, it’s like appreciating the beauty of art. 2. For the first time, I felt that perfectionists are so intimidating, their pursuit of perfection despite personality flaws is too frightening. 3. The name 'Laura' is so beautiful. Just seeing this name is like smelling perfume, I don’t understand why in this movie this name feels so wonderful. Of course, it has a lot to do with how extremely beautiful the female lead is, like a dazzling, pure and beautiful flower emerging from a fetid swamp. 4. Life without love is so barren, so distorted, so pitiable; the terrible things they do cannot be blamed on him! He has done so much, even he does not realize, he just wanted to be loved. Why couldn't he be loved, why must his life be destined to be forgotten and ignored? 5. Never expected this movie, ranked 218th, to be so outstanding. Definitely must read the original book.
