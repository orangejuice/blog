British scholar Ansgar Allen's book 'Cynicism,' originally published by the MIT Press in 2020, was also translated into Simplified Chinese in 2023.

Cynicism is rampant in all totalitarian states, and China is no exception. For individuals, the most critical step to overcoming cynicism is to adhere to principles and refrain from knowingly committing wrongdoings: if you know something is wrong, do not do it, nor make excuses for yourself.
