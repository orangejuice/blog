Via tw ignatius lee, 'Cynicism' by British scholar Ansgar Allen published by the MIT Press in 2020, was also translated into Simplified Chinese in 2023. Cynicism is prevalent in all totalitarian countries, and China is no exception. For individuals, the key to overcoming cynicism is to adhere to principles and avoid knowingly doing wrong: if you know something is wrong, do not do it and do not make excuses for yourself.
