A concrete work of Henan literature, the characters in the book feel intimate and represent a microcosm of countless hardworking Chinese elders. The book conveys a profound and realistic sense of life and familial bonds, with the responsibilities and resilience of the elders having a lifelong impact. Such things are precious; though they seem natural on paper, they are still bitterly hard to endure. One wonders how many families can consistently achieve this. In a world filled with countless temptations and obstacles, without the efforts of a group of conscientious people, crossing social classes would be as elusive as fishing the moon from the water. Yan Lianke's literary growth, steeped in family, homeland, and military experiences, is both unique and fortunate.
