A tangible work of literature from Henan, with characters who are relatable and represent countless diligent and earnest Chinese elderly. The rich and real sense of life, the authentic and powerful family affection, and the responsibility and resilience of the elders create a lifelong impact. These elements are so precious, and although they seem natural on paper, they are also bitter and hard to bear. It makes one think about how many families can consistently achieve all of this. There are countless temptations and obstacles in this world, and without a group's effort, a conscientious person crossing social classes is like trying to fish the moon out of the water. Yan Lianke's growth in literature, being immersed in his family, native land, and army, is a unique and fortunate experience.
