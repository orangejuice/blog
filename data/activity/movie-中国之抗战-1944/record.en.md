The vicissitudes of life seem like a different world, yet they constantly bring a hint of sadness to the heart. It is a pity that the closed and backward civilization caused the country to miss the opportunity to complete independent development and industrial transformation. When asked why China has reached where it is today, we will find that the answer is written on everyone, written on every piece of land, even written in Japan, Soviet Union, Southeast Asia, written in the United States.
