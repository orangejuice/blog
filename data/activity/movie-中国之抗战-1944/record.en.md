The vast changes in landscape evoke sensations of a bygone era, often stirring a trace of melancholy. Regrettably, the isolation and backwardness of the civilization missed the opportunity for independent development and industrial transformation. The tangled threads of history are tightly interwoven. When questioning why China has reached its current stage, the answers can be found engraved on each individual, in every piece of land, and even in the contexts of Japan, the Soviet Union, Southeast Asia, and the USA.
