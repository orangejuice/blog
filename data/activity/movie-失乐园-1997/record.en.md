Via tw chasing a deer / via tw luckylab_vicky - Junichiro Watanabe's love novels often carry a sense of despair as if the end of the world, coupled with a strong Japanese-style sensuality. He once said, 'Almost every piece of my work contains my own personal experience, a writer must bravely express his likes and dislikes to resonate with the reader.' Micro comment: The joys and sorrows, emotional and physical needs of people are all important and precious. In his eyes, 'natural people' always accord more closely with human nature than 'social people'.
