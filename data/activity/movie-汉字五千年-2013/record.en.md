What I love most are the lively animations filled with ancient charm and imagination. The content cannot compare, although there are some unique insights supported by historical facts. However, the continuous and unreserved revelation of points of view throughout the film, along with too much idle talk, overshadows the effort put into using animation to interpret characters and trace history, which could have been more functional. I am not sure if there are similar works out there. The major drawback is this underlying stance, giving off an inflated sense of self-importance, expressed in an impassioned and arrogant tone, full of subjective presumptions. Perhaps this is a reflection of the mentality from the Confucius Institute and the Han Affairs Office. Viewers can discern for themselves. A minor flaw, the quality of the circulated versions is too poor, with grey and gloomy visuals. This documentary is very representative, subtly revealing some information about the screenwriter, and also the mentality of this nation and what it is thinking.
