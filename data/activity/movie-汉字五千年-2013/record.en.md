What I liked most was the lively, ancient-flavored, imaginative animation. Surprisingly, the content can hardly compare to it; though there are some unique insights supported by historical data, the views are expressed too straightforwardly throughout, leaving no room for subtlety—too much banal chatter. It would have been better to spend more effort on using animation to explain characters and trace history, making it more useful. I’m unsure if there are similar works. The major flaw is this basic stance, being too self-important, with an impassioned and arrogant tone, presumptuously subjective—this might also reflect the official mindset of institutions like the “Confucius Institute” and the “Hanban”. Viewers should discern for themselves. A minor flaw is the poor clarity of the widely distributed versions, resulting in dull and gloomy visuals. This documentary is very representative, subtly revealing some information about the screenwriters, as well as about the mentality of this nation and what it might be contemplating.
