Fascinating from many broad and nuanced perspectives. A rich man's simulation farm turned into a reality show spectacleâ€”a rare gem among reality TV productions. The remote Oxfordshire farm intersects with the realities of societal events. Operating machinery, running a business, financial freedom, racing, and flying, the support of a spouse and fans, optimistic engagement with the world, and navigating the complex local political ecology paint an idyllic pastoral scene.
