Truly fascinating, expanding horizons from various big and small perspectives. The rich man's simulated farm, the reality show of the simulated farm, and the rare masterpiece of the reality show. The remote Oxfordshire farm in the UK intersects with social events. Operating machinery, business management, financial freedom, racing flight, brothers and beautiful wives, a group of fans who accept themselves, optimistically engage in the world, challenge the tedious and complex local political ecology, a picture of idealistic pastoral beauty.
