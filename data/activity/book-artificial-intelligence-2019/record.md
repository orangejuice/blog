  title: Artificial Intelligence
  subtitle: Melanie Mitchell / 2019 / Pelican
  intro: >-
    No recent scientific enterprise has been so alluring, terrifying, and filled
    with extravagant promise and frustrating setbacks as artificial
    intelligence. How intelligent are the best of today's AI programs? To what
    extent can we entrust them with decisions that affect our lives? How
    human-like do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry
    about them surpassing us in most, if not all, human endeavours?

    From leading AI researcher and award-winning author Melanie Mitchell comes a
    knowledgeable and captivating account of modern-day artificial intelligence.
    Flavoured with personal stories and a twist of humor, Artificial
    Intelligence illuminates the workings of machines that mimic human learning,
    perception, language, creativity and common sense. Weaving together advances
    in AI with cognitive science and philosophy, Mitchell probes the extent to
    which today's 'smart' machines can actually think or understand, and whether
    AI requires such elusive human qualities in order to be reliable,
    trustworthy and beneficial.

    Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans provides readers with
    an accessible, entertaining, and clear-eyed view of the AI landscape, what
    the field has actually accomplished, how much further it has to go, and what
    it means for all of our futures.
