  title: The UltraMind Solution
  subtitle: Hyman, Mark M.D. / 2010
  intro: "Is your brain broken?    We refer to our broken brains by many
    names—depression, anxiety, memory loss, brain fog, ADHD, autism, to name a
    few—and although we can’t see it, this silent epidemic affects more than 1
    billion people worldwide.   If you can answer yes to any of the following,
    you may have a broken brain:    Are you depressed, feeling down, and don’t
    have the drive to do anything?     Do you find it next to impossible to
    focus or concentrate?       Do you get anxious, worried, or stressed-out
    frequently?       Does your mind feel foggy, unable to experience the world
    clearly?    All is not lost. In  The UltraMind Solution, New York
    Times  bestselling author Mark Hyman shows that to fix your broken brain,
    you must heal your body first. Dr. Hyman presents a simple six-week plan
    based on the emerging field of functional medicine to restore health and
    gain an UltraMind—one that’s highly focused, able to pay attention at will,
    has a strong memory, and leaves us feeling calm, confident, in control, and
    in good spirits."
