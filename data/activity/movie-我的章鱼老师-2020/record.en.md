It didn't particularly shock me, perhaps because the ratings had set my expectations higher. Although the director attempts to tell a personal story, it feels as though he has grown indifferent, just continuing on without caring whether or not you are captivated by his story. It somewhat mirrors my own state of mind. The visuals are indeed rare, and the filming was certainly not easy. Two moments particularly moved me: 1. The octopus clinging to him as if giving a last hug and thank you for appearing in her brief life and providing her with a unique chapter of experiences. 2. After the octopes dies, being held in the jaws of a shark with its tentacles drifting elegantly with the water flow.
