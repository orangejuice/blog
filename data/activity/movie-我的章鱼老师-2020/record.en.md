I wasn't particularly shocked by it, perhaps because the rating created high expectations for me. Although the director tries to tell a story from his own experience, it feels as if he's indifferent, just going on, not caring whether you can be attracted by his story. It feels somewhat like my own state. The footage is truly rare and filming must have been difficult. Two parts deeply moved me: 1. The octopus clinging to him seemed like a final embrace and gratitude for appearing in her short life and giving her a unique chapter. 2. After the octopus passed away, being carried in the mouth of a shark, its tentacles fluttering with the current - it was really elegant.
