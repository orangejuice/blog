  title: The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz
  subtitle: L. , Frank , L. Baum / 2005 / 1st World Library - Literary Society
  intro: Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through
    the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love
    for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal. The winged fairies
    of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than
    all other human creations. Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for
    generations, may now be classed as "historical" in the children's library;
    for the time has come for a series of newer "wonder tales" in which the
    stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the
    horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a
    fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore
    the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly
    dispenses with all disagreeable incident.
