I watched 20 episodes. I came for the costume and setting recommended by Teacher Yuan, and indeed, the craftsmanship is commendable. The styling is pleasing to the eye, based on historical facts instead of misleading fabrications, which deserves a star. The character development isn't just a simple good vs. evil conflict, which is good. However, the core of the story hasn't improved; it's slow-moving and lacks simplicity and sophistication, clearly tailored for teenage girls with its na√Øve and overly sweet romantic subplot, not suitable for adult viewers. In summary, it's a series without ideals or vision, solely catering to its target audience as a consumer product. It always ends up being a disappointment despite the initial excitement. I wonder how long it will be until there is a Chinese drama worth keeping in one's collection.
