I persisted through 20 episodes. I came to appreciate the recommendations of Teacher Yuan for wardrobe and props, which were indeed well done, providing visually pleasing styling and grounding the show in historical reality instead of misleading fabrications â€“ for this, it gets a star. The character development is not too bad, not simply delineating between good and evil factions. However, the core of the show has not improved, the plot drags, lacking in brisk decisiveness. The immature 'sweet and innocent' love rival scenes are clearly tailored for young females, as if adults don't deserve to watch dramas. In conclusion, it is still a commodity without ideals or scope, merely catering to a target audience, every watch ends in disappointment. I wonder how much longer we would have to wait for a Chinese drama worthy of collection.
