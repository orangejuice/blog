Regarding the translation, can the translator understand what it means? How could it pass through various checks and get published? This is a bit of a pity. The topics are all good, had a quick look, quickly skipped the poorly translated parts, but still found it interesting :) Saw someone saying there are too many words, that's right, really admire the author, he can really write.
