This translation, can the translator even understand what they wrote? How did it pass through so many checks and get published? That's a bit of a shame. The topics are good, and I skimmed through it; I quickly skipped the poorly translated parts, but it's still somewhat interesting :) I saw some say it's too wordy, and they're right, I really admire the author, such a prolific writer.
