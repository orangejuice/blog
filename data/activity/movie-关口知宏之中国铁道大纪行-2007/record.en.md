The simplicity of communication is really touching. Without realizing it, 14 years have passed between 2007 and 2021. Some parts of China shown in the camera have disappeared or faded, while others remain the same. Those children in the scenes have now grown up, which is truly sigh-inducing. Only after watching did I realize that each episode was as long as two hours, but every episode was interesting to watch. Reluctantly, I say goodbye to this wonderful railway journey.
