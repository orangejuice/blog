Simple interactions can be very touching. From 2007 to 2021, 14 years have passed without notice. The China shown through the lens has partly faded away, while some of it remains. The children in those scenes have now grown up, which is truly poignant. After watching, I realized each episode is two hours long, yet I found every episode captivating and was reluctant to say goodbye to this wonderful railway journey.
