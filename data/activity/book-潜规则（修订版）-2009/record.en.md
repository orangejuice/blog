Via tw Munie This year I read these two books in total. The first one I should probably read twice or three times because it's so real and eye-opening (truly exciting). If I had read it ten years ago or even earlier, it could have saved me from many detours. All the rules you think of, whether overt or covert, are simply continuations from the ancient times. Which gave me my deepest impression, it made me think, if we go by the current education system, these 'obsolete rules' will continue to exist, so long as you live on this land.
