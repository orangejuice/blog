Via Twitter Munie: This year I have read these two books only. The first one I will probably reread two or three times; it's so real and an eye-opener (truly fascinating). If I had read this ten or more years earlier, it could have saved me from many detours. All the rules you think of, whether overt or covert, have been handed down from ancient times. It left a profound impression on me, reminding me of how 'bad practices' will continue under the current educational system as long as you live in this land.
