Poverty and ignorance are diseases, one strips the body, the other the soul. We need not only economic prosperity but also ideological enlightenment. The character Xianglin's sister-in-law embodies countless anonymous mothers who are powerless over their own fate and regard their children as the center of the world. But destiny has no understanding of human sentiment. No matter how competent and diligent, if born in peaceful times, one can muddle through life; if born in troubled times, countless sorrows and hardships are inevitable. The one-child policy has harmed helpless only children as well as mothers whose only spiritual support is confined to a single child.
