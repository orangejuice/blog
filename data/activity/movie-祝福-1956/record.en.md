Diseases of poverty and ignorance take over the body and soul, snatching from the left and the right. While a prosperous economy is needed, so too is the enlightenment of minds. Sister Xianglin's character represents countless unknown mothers, who, though helpless, see their children as the center of their worlds. Yet fate knows no kindnessâ€”what does hard work count for, if born in an era of peace, one merely survives, but if born in turmoil, countless miseries undulate through life? The one-child policy has harmed not only the lonely, only child but also the mothers for whom this only child was their sole emotional support.
