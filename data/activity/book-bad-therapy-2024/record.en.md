Via tw mindfroge: This is one of the most eye-opening books I've ever read, and it's a must-read for all parents, teachers, and school administrators. The book deeply explores why mental health issues among children are so serious despite the substantial resources put into improving mental health conditions. Anxiety, depression, and suicide are all on the rise among children, a perplexing trend given that their living conditions are arguably better than ever before. Key points from the book include: Constant attention to children's feelings or thoughts can have negative effects. Continually contemplating your own emotions and feelings can have a negative impact on your mental health. If you're always focused on your emotions, you're bound to be anxious or depressed. We continuously ask children how they feel, whether they're happy, how their mental health is, etc., which makes them feel fragile rather than resilient. Attempting to solve all the problems children encounter leads to a generation of people who can't do anything on their own.
