From a tweet by 'mindfroge,' this is one of the most eye-opening books I've read. It's a must-read for any parent, teacher, and any school administrator. The book delves into why mental health issues among children are so severe nowadays despite significant resources being poured into improving mental health. Issues like anxiety, depression, and suicide are on the rise among children, although it could be argued that they live in better conditions than ever before. This is truly baffling. Key points in the book: Constantly focusing on children's feelings or thoughts has negative impacts. Continually dwelling on your own emotions and feelings can negatively affect your mental health. If you always focus on your emotions, you are destined to be anxious or depressed. We keep asking children how they feel, whether they are happy, and about their mental health, etc., which makes them feel vulnerable rather than resilient. Trying to solve all problems children face has led to a generation that can't do anything by themselves.
