A couple of days ago, I heard the song 'Looking Back,' and for some reason, the lyrics “Looking Back, It Seems Like A Dream,” echoed in my ears as I watched this film. The records presented of this historical period are rare. Just by this point, it's already quite good. The effort put into the filming, the casting of amateur actors and children, and the construction of some scenes are commendable. However, one issue is that in every street scene, billowing smoke from chimneys seems intentional and attention-drawing. Other aspects include: the structure is loose; none of the numerous cast are well-developed; the Blue Kite symbolism seems superfluous. The narrative language of the entire film tastes like plain and unadorned vernacular speech. Though the meaning is clear, it lacks a central idea in its expression, resulting in language that lacks precision and depth. Language truly is an art. Of course, I still watched it seriously to the end.
