A couple of days ago, I happened to hear the song 'Looking Back,' and for some reason, as I watched this film, the lyrics 'Looking back, it all seems like a dream' kept echoing in my ears. The film's documentation of this historical period is truly rare and, on this point alone, it is already commendably good. The film made considerable efforts, involving many amateur actors and children, and some effort is evident in the construction of scenes. However, there is one point: in every street scene, the chimneys are always billowing thick smoke, which feels overdone and invariably draws all my attention. Other aspects: The structure is particularly loose, and none of the massive castâ€™s characters are fully developed. The imagery of the blue kite is dispensable. The narrative language of the entire film feels like plain, unadorned vernacular. Although the message is understandable and everyone can grasp that it is a shocking tragic story, the expression lacks a central idea, making the language neither concise nor profound. Language truly is an art form. Of course, I still watched it earnestly till the end.
