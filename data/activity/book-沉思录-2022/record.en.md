Via tw brave2049 In November 2007, while visiting Singapore, Wen Jiabao mentioned 'Meditations' by Ancient Roman author Marcus Aurelius, 'This book is always by my bedside, I may have read it a hundred times. I read it every day.' Besides, Wen Jiabao has recommended Adam Smith's 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments' several times, saying that its significance is no less than 'The Wealth of Nations'. In 2008, the Central Compilation and Translation Press released a new version of 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments' with a recommendation by Wen Jiabao on the book cover.
