Via Twitter by brave2049, November 2007, during Wen Jiabao's visit to Singapore, he mentioned Marcus Aurelius' 'Meditations' from ancient Rome, 'This book is always by my bed, I might have read it 100 times. I read it every day.'

Additionally, Wen Jiabao repeatedly recommended Adam Smith's 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments', stating its significance is no less than 'The Wealth of Nations'. In 2008, the Central Compilation & Translation Press released a new edition of 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments' with a belly band featuring Wen Jiabao's 'recommendation'.
