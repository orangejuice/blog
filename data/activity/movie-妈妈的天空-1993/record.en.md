This is a movie released in 1993, starring Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates. The story backdrop: A single mother is raising 6 children on her own. They move from California to Ohio, and the family is very poor. They experience a fire, but their poverty doesn't defeat them. I like the sentence from the mother in the movie very much: 'What we need to do is to use the limited resources we have in our hands to work hard to create a better life. Life is inherently unequal. We can't compare ourselves to others, but we can strive to make ourselves and our children live better.'
