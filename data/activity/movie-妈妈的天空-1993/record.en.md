This is a 1993 film released, starring Academy Award-winning actress Kathy Bates.

Story Background:
A single mother raises six children alone, moving from California to Ohio. The family is very poor, experiences a fire, but poverty didn't defeat them.
One favorite quote from the mother in the film is:
â€œAll we need to do
is use the limited resources we have
to work hard to create a better life

Life is inherently unequal
We cannot compare with others
but we can strive to make life better for ourselves and our children.
