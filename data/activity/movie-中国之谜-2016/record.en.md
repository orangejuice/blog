Mysteries of China from Magellan TV, recommended by the Voices of the Past channel. The production is exceptional, the visuals are meticulously natural, and the storytelling is interesting, progressing step by step. Just a few minutes into it and I decided I had to watch it entirely. I was pleasantly surprised in the end to see that a lot of work was done by a Chinese team. I also unexpectedly saw Jin Tielin's name. It's too short, I couldn't get enough - how great it would be if it were a series. There are too many stories in this country that are still untold. I took off one point because the title is a clickbait, such a big title only gave a general introduction to Emperor Qin Shi Huang.
