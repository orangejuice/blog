Mysteries of China from magellan tv, recommended by Voices of the past channel. The production quality is exceptional, the visuals are meticulously natural and the story is interesting, progressing gradually. It only took a few minutes before I decided to watch it all. Surprisingly, a Chinese team did a lot of work on it, and seeing Jin Tiemu's name was unexpected. It's too short; I haven't had enough, it would be great if it were a series. This country has too many stories that are still sleeping. I deduct a point for clickbait title; such a grand title only offers a brief introduction to Emperor Qin Shi Huang.
