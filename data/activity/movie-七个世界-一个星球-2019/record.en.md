Every year we are fortunate to see superbly crafted high-standard nature documentaries. I hope these documentaries continue forever, never running out of material. Living on Earth, humans have become increasingly estranged from nature. Lonely people tread the earth unsupported, while joyful people revel and laugh in the world of capital elites. Looking into the eyes of a young orangutan, I hope nature gives humanity another chance. Youthful, short-sighted human beings, greedy for the moment, will return to nature. A lifestyle full of artistic, cultural, natural care, closely connected with others and other life forms, responsible, loving, healthy, mutually beneficial, shared, natural, eternal.
