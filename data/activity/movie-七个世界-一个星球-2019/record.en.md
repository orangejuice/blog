We are so lucky to have superbly produced high-level nature documentaries to watch every year. I hope these documentaries will continue to be made forever and will never run out of material. We live on Earth but are becoming increasingly unfamiliar with nature. Lonely people step on the land without a haven, while happy people indulge in laughter in the capitalist world. Looking into the eyes of a young orangutan, I hope nature can give humans another chance. I hope that young and ignorant people, who are greedy for the moment, will return to nature. This documentary is full of art, culture, natural care, and is closely related to others and other lives. Responsible, philanthropic, healthy, mutually beneficial, shared, natural, eternal.
