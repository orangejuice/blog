Via Twitter from Douxiaodou: I no longer pretend to have many friends; instead, I return to solitude, beginning a life on my own as the true me. Sometimes, the torment of emptiness due to loneliness is unbearable, but I prefer to maintain my self-respect this way rather than trading my dignity for superficial friendships.
