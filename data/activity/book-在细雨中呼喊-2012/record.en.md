Via tw Dou Xiaodou I no longer pretend to have many friends, but return to solitude, starting a lone life with the genuine me. Sometimes I can't bear the torment of emptiness due to loneliness, but I'd rather maintain my dignity in this way than exchange it for superficial friendship at the cost of humiliation.
