Deducting points for script language, the narration overly dramatizes the difficulties, always highlighting perilous moments that nearly ended in failure. Phrases like 'if not for this and that, it couldn't be so and so,' and 'thanks to so and so, we accomplished such and such,' detract from the immersive and lifelike experience. The camera work, while seeking grandeur and cohesion with perfect multi-angle transitions, can sometimes be distracting. However, the visuals and the story are genuinely excellent and can be considered a treasure.
