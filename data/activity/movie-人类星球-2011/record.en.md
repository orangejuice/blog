Deducting a point for the script. The overly dramatic narrative tends to focus on the perilous moments, often almost failing to capture them. The 'what ifs' and 'thanks tos' disrupt the immersion and sense of realism. Despite the camera's pursuit of beauty and completeness, even the multi-angle switching is a bit... But the visuals and story-telling are indeed excellent, can be considered a treasure.
