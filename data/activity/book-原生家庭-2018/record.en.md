Via tw pandazhq, the book discusses how our behavior patterns in intimate relationships are primarily derived from our first families, suggesting that the challenges you face with your husband and children are rooted in behaviors developed in your parental relationships. If you struggle in your intimate relationships, it might be more crucial to resolve issues with your parents. It's not always that the other person is without faults, but we should first clear the issues brought about by our own families, fully accept and trust ourselves before we can truly identify the crux of the problems.

Some children, neglected or abused by their parents during childhood, see family as their sole means of survival. In an attempt to gain parental approval, they suppress their true feelings, habitually please others to receive emotional feedback, unconsciously choose abusive partners, and might come to view abuse as a normal part of life.
