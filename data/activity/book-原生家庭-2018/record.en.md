This book argues that our patterns of behaviour in handling intimate relationships largely stem from our own originated families. This means that most of the issues you encounter in dealing with your spouse and children are the behavioral patterns that were formed in your interactions with your parents. If you are facing obstacles in dealing with intimate relationships, what you may need to resolve is your relationship with your parents. It's not to say that there are no issues with the other party, but we need to first clear out the problems brought about by our own originated families, and only after fully accepting and trusting ourselves can we understand where the crux of the problem lies.

Some children who are neglected and abused by their parents and for whom the family is their only source of survival, in order to gain their parents' approval, will suppress their true feelings, get used to pleasing others to get emotional feedback, unconsciously look for a partner who abuses them, and even think that abuse is part of a normal life.
