In memory, it is a sunny and hopeful warm story, but on revisiting, the film is full of deprivation and desolation at the brink of a cliff. The mental quality of the protagonist exceeds ordinary people. He is smart and eloquent, struggling hard on the edge of the abyss, coupled with destiny's favor and help from a benefactor, finally turns his life around. The cruel competition depicted in the film is heartbreaking, one is the long line outside the shelter, it seems natural for those whose spots are already full and have nowhere to go, the second is the 30 interns outside of the shot, poor and hardworking, but with only one opportunity, where will the unnamed of them go after six months?
