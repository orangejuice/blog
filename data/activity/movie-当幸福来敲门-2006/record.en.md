In memory, it was a sunny, hopeful, and warm story, but revisiting it revealed that the whole film was an edgy and precarious struggle from the depths of despair. The protagonist's psychological resilience exceeds that of an ordinary person, exhibiting clever wit and articulate speech while struggling on the brink of an abyss. With a bit of luck and help from influential figures, he finally manages to turn his life around. The film also portrays harsh competition: first, the long line outside the homeless shelter, with no room left for those remaining as if it was taken for granted; second, the 30 interns off-camera, many impoverished and hardworking, with only one opportunity at handâ€”what happens to the nameless ones after six months?
