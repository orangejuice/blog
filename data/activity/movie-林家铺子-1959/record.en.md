      comment: Via douban, Algernon's Bouquet - A splash of dirty water pollutes the
        clear rivers of the Jiangnan town, as if it is a metaphor. Following
        this, the contradictions at Lin Yuanji continually escalate, making the
        lives of the lower class even more difficult amid this "dirty water".
        Whether it's Boss Lin who can't pay off debts and abandons his family,
        or the widow who can't recover her principal and whose child tragically
        dies, both are tragic characters shaped by the era.

The film exerts its power, with a tension-filled ending. Under the corrupt and unstable situation of the wealthy and influential, the life of the lower class struggling on the poverty line is so helpless and terrifying. Tragedy becomes a commonplace as no amount of misery buys sympathy, and selfish scheming becomes the norm, with everyone trying to protect themselves, yet no one can truly secure themselves. In this land, the perilous game of survival, especially under the failure of state governance, is particularly fearsome.
