      comment: Via douban, Bouquet of Algernon, a splash of dirty water pollutes the
        clear river of the small Jiangnan town, as if it's a metaphor. The
        ensuing conflicts in Lin's Shop grow increasingly intense, and the lives
        of the lower classes are made more difficult in this basin of 'dirty
        water'. Whether it's the boss, Lin, who can't repay his debts and
        abandons his family, or the widow who can't get back her principal and
        whose child dies a tragic death, they are all tragic figures shaped by
        the times.

The film shows its power, with a taut ending. Life, struggling below the poverty line, is so helpless and terrifying amidst the pervasive corruption and unrest of the authorities and business. Begging yields no pity, selfish calculations become the norm, everyone strives for self-protection, and everyone is unable to protect themselves. This game of survival on this land is especially terrifying under failed state governance.
