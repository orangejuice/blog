Ada, who doesn't conform to society, has built walls around her own world. The mother and daughter, both eccentric and aloof, are unpopular and forced to marry off far away. Ada marries Stewart, a stingy and tactless man, but then meets George, a burly, gentle, and understanding man. George's tenderness, his use of power to subdue women, and his moral torment lead Ada through a struggle between obedience and resistance, eventually breaking down her walls and accepting George. Her reminiscent attachment to the piano, her act of defiant betrayal, and declaration of love leave a lasting impression. When Stewart, in pursuit of a land deal, forces her to stay alone with another man, he loses by his own greed. Yet, in the end, he voluntarily gives up, making way for the couple. The complexity of human nature is fully displayed.
