Ada stands out from the crowd, building walls surrounding her own world. The eccentric mother and daughter, unwelcome and forced to marry afar. Married to the stingy, dull Stewart, they encounter the robust, gentle, and understanding George. George's tenderness, his use of power to win over women, and the torment of morality, Ada melts her walls and accepts George during the tug of war between compliance and resistance. Her longing triggered by the piano, her relentless betrayal and confession of love, leave a deep impression. When Stewart let his woman stay in the same room with another man for a land deal, he has already lost to his own greed. But in the end, he willingly gave up, making way for the two. The complexity of human nature is fully displayed.
