via tw fiona Recently read a book recommended by a friend, the miraculous trader @cissan_9984, and found many trading strategies to be refreshing. First, cis is hailed as Japan's legendary individual trader, whose tweets can shake the Nikkei Index. He started with 3 million yen, and by 2018, his assets reached 23 billion yen. 1️⃣ Stocks that continue to rise will keep rising, and stocks that continue to fall will keep falling, so one must 'trade with the trend'. (However, this is based on cis primarily doing day trading) 2️⃣ Never 'buy on pullbacks'. Buying on pullbacks is a 'counter-trend operation' 3️⃣ 'Averaging down' is the worst technique. Because averaging down sometimes leads to bankruptcy. When losing money, one must stop loss instead of averaging down, which increases the money invested and assumes greater risk. 4️⃣ Focusing only on 'taking profits' can miss out on larger market swings. The key is not the win rate, but the total profit and loss, focusing on small losses and big gains, using large gains to ensure overall positivity in returns.
