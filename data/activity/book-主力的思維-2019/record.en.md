I recently read this book recommended by a friend from miracle trader @cissan_9984, who opened my eyes on many trading strategies.

Firstly, cis is touted as Japan’s 'God of Retail Investors' who can shake the Nikkei Index just by tweeting. He started with 3 million yen and his assets had reached 230 billion yen by 2018.

1️⃣ A continuously rising stock will continue to rise, and a continuously falling stock will continue to fall, so it is important to 'trade with the trend'. (However, this is based on cis mainly doing day trading)

2️⃣ Never 'buy on the dip'. Buying on the dip is a form of 'counter-trend trading'

3️⃣ 'Averaging down' is the worst strategy. Because sometimes averaging down can lead to bankruptcy, one should stop losses instead of averaging down, increasing the invested capital, and taking on more risk.

4️⃣ Only focusing on 'taking profits' can cause missed opportunities in larger trends.

The key is not the winning rate, but the total profit and loss, emphasizing a strategy of small losses, big gains, and using the big gains to make the overall returns positive.
