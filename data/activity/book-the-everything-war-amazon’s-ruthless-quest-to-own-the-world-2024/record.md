  title: "The Everything War: Amazon’s Ruthless Quest to Own the World"
  subtitle: Dana Mattioli / 2024 / Little, Brown and Company
  intro: >-
    “Riveting and explosive.” – Christopher Leonard

    From veteran Amazon reporter for The Wall Street Journal, The Everything War
    is the first untold, devastating exposé of Amazon's endless strategic greed,
    from destroying Main Street to remaking corporate power, in pursuit of total
    domination, by any means necessary.

    In 2017, Lina Khan published a paper that accused Amazon of being a
    monopoly, having grown so large, and embedded in so many industries, it was
    akin to a modern-day Standard Oil. Unlike Rockefeller’s empire, however,
    Bezos’s company had grown voraciously without much scrutiny. In fact, for
    over twenty years, Amazon had emerged as a Wall Street darling and its
    “customer obsession” approach made it indelibly attractive to consumers
    across the globe. But the company was not benevolent; it operated in ways
    that ensured it stayed on top. Lina Khan’s paper would light a fire in
    Washington, and in a matter of years, she would become the head of the FTC.
    In 2023, the FTC filed a monopoly lawsuit against Amazon in what may become
    one of the largest antitrust cases in the 21st century.

    With unparalleled access, and having interviewed hundreds of people – from
    Amazon executives to competitors to small businesses who rely on its
    marketplace to survive – Mattioli exposes how Amazon was driven by a
    competitive edge to dominate every industry it entered, bulldozed all who
    stood in its way, reshaped the retail landscape, transformed how Wall Street
    evaluates companies, and altered the very nature of the global economy. It
    has come to control most of online retail, and uses its own sellers’ data to
    compete with them through Amazon’s own private label brands. Millions of
    companies and governmental agencies use AWS, paying hefty fees for the
    service. And, the company has purposefully avoided collecting taxes for
    years, exploited partners, and even copied competitors—leveraging its power
    to extract whatever it can, at any cost. It has continued to gain market
    share in disparate areas, from media to logistics and beyond. Most companies
    dominate one or two industries; Amazon now leads in several. And all of this
    was by design.

    The Everything War is the definitive, inside story of how it grew into one
    of the most powerful and feared companies in the world – and why this
    lawsuit opens a window into the most consequential business story of our
    times.
