Via tw Stopping Cloud 'Rather stand on the side of silence, than on the side of noise; would rather lose speech, than betray the solemn feelings of sorrow in the heart, and definitely not immediately learning the language and tone of the powerful' The uncontrollable need to reread this book. Faced with the same major sufferings and absurdities of the twentieth century, compared to Milan Kundera's prudence and profound insight, Milosz possesses the power of transcendence and compassion. This is admirable and respected!
