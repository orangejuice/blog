Via Twitter from Tingyun: 'Better to stand on the side of silence than on the side of noise; better to be speechless than to betray the mournful solemnity in one’s heart, and certainly not to immediately adopt the language and tone of the oppressors.' An uncontrollable need to reread this book. Facing the major tragedies and absurdities of the twentieth century, Miłosz possesses a transcendent and compassionate power, compared to Milan Kundera's cautiousness and profound insights, which commands respect and admiration!
