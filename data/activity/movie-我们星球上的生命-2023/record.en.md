Lizards ruled over the hot desert landscapes of the Pangea continent, while turtles decided to return to the sea from the land. / Episode 5: During the age of dinosaurs, flowers appeared and evolved through insect pollination, competing to attract the best pollinators, turning the terrestrial landscape from monochrome green to vibrant multicolor, leading to an explosion of biodiversity.
