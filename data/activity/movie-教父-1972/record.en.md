It's quite bewildering for those with prosopagnosia. The Godfather's performance is spectacular, he embodies sincerity and tenacity in dealing with people and tasks, and his unrelenting dedication to his family and life shines. The contrast is wonderfully formed as Michael, carrying these abilities, is youthful and impetuous, less kind and adept than his father. Michael is goal-oriented, sharp-witted and meticulous, decisive and unhesitatingly exposed.
