People with face blindness find it very confusing. The Godfather's performance is spectacular, showing a serious and sincere demeanor in handling affairs, and a committed stance towards family and life. Michael inherits these abilities, and his youthful vigor and less gregarious nature compared to his father provides a striking contrast. Michael has clear objectives, a sharp and meticulous mind, and is decisive and formidable in execution.
