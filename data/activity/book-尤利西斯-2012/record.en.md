via Twitter by Dou Xiaodou - Every life is made up of many days, day after day. We move forward through our own lives, encountering robberg, ghosts, giants, old people, young people, daughters-in-law, widows, and loving brothers, but what we always encounter is ourselves. â€” James Joyce, "Ulysses"
