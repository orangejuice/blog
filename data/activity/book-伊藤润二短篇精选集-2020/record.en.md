Via Twitter @Tingyun. Previously, I found Junji Ito's works bizarre and inconceivable, which made them very intriguing. Revisiting them years later, it turns out that what I experienced was a silent fear. The author externalizes human nature on a grand scale, presenting it nakedly. The inconceivable part is humanity itself.
