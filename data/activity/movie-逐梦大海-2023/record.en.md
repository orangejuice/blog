Via tw Minzblatt, it seems like an experiment to spend three to six months in a temple/tropical island/mountain forest without electronic devices, without contact with the outside world, meditating, walking, reading, writing, and sleeping on time every day. I wonder what it feels like to come out of isolation not knowing what the future holds. Maybe start by watching this movie? I once went on a trek for a month. The whole process was very enjoyable, but it ended up being more depressive when I returned to society.
