A profound enlightenment, it inspired much thinking and pursuit, making me perceive the brilliance of wisdom. It systematically and comprehensively explains our country's economic history and current operations, pointing out existing flaws. It's an especially good, logically robust introductory reading material for understanding China's economy.
