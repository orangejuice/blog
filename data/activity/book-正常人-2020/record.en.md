Via Twitter user Tingyun: We have been ashamed to talk about love in novels for a long time. 'Normal People' is the most touching love story I have read in the past two years. What we see in the novel is that even amidst so much inequality, we can still feel love, because in all relationships, interpersonal interactions ultimately affect oneself, forming a process that confronts one's own self.
