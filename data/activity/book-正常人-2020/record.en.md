Via tw Stop Cloud suggests that we've been too shy to talk about love in novels for a long time, 'Normal People' is the most touching romantic novel I have read in the last two years. In the novel, even though there is so much inequality, we can still feel love, because in all relationships, interactions between people will eventually affect ourselves, making us face ourselves.
