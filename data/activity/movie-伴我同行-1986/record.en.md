Ordinary personal experiences occur without warning, little did we know they would become everlasting memories for the latter part of our lives. This hazy adventure is a treasure that the older generation can't exhaust, yet our generation nearly misses out on. Mentioned by the psychologist in 'Bountiful Poor', this film is fantastic.
