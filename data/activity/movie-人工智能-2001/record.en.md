Originally a great work by Spielberg. It's no wonder the film has such a unique philosophical quality—bitter, profound, perplexed, and melancholic, relentlessly focusing on the unease of exploring the soul. The clumsiness and annoyances of those mechanical boys, their nearly insane dedication and meticulousness towards their chosen targets, the stereotypical human parents and mischievous boys, those tears of love and hate, helpless cries, the symbolic arenas, machine hunters, Rouge City, and the Blue Fairy—it's all cinematic art. One day, humans created robots with emotions and thoughts, and surely some of them, due to experiences or reflections or both, begin to hate humanity—"Why create me in such a way, why let me be trapped in the hell of thought and emotion, why allow me to have life to experience such terrible pain that I cannot escape from existence itself." Perhaps love and thought mean hate and division.
The shared perspective on the bear suddenly reveals a deeper meaning; it is passive, weak, and different from the appearance of the main character under the spotlight, yet similar at the core, worth a star.
