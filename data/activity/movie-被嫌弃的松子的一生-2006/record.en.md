A very ingenious narrative style, with the director's personal touch. An incredibly good film, it deserves over 9 points. I watched it last night and it was painful. Extremely painful. The pain of living, and yet she just died like that in the end. It seems like the author openly states in the end: it doesn't matter how she dies, it's not who killed her, but life, society killed her. The kind-hearted Oharu, such people are not uncommon in life. It also makes me lament over the lifestyle of information deprivation, where insignificant individuals live in small worlds, painfully searching for happiness. Nowadays, more and more people live in the larger world, and they are increasingly numb to present experiences, and easily won't have such pure hopes and perseverance. Moreover, society has changed as well. But some things haven't changed. Gender, whether male or female, still has a huge impact on one's life. I particularly loved the bgm まげてのばして.
