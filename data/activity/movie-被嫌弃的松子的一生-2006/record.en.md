The narrative style is very clever, reflecting the director's personal touch. An extraordinary movie, deserving a score above 9. Watched it last night, and it was heartbreaking. The pain of living was immense, and her death at the end was just so. It felt as if the author explicitly said: It doesn't matter how she died; it wasn't about who killed her, but how life, society did. Matsuko, a character not uncommon in real life, also highlights the insular nature of certain lifestyles. It’s sad how 'small people' in their small worlds desperately seek happiness amidst suffering – a stark contrast to today's broader worlds where people are increasingly desensitized, losing that pure hope and persistence. Moreover, society has changed, yet some things remain the same. Gender still significantly impacts lives. I especially liked the background music 'まげてのばして'.
