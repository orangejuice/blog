Via Twitter user @wuguge, "Before the age of 20, I read a few important books that changed my life. One of them was Palmer's 'Modern World History,' a 1992 edition from the Commercial Press. Although titled 'World History,' it is in fact a European history textbook. It discusses how modern society was formed in Europe and spread worldwide, narrating with the triumphant confidence of Western society during the late Cold War. This book helped me overcome the brainwashing effects of my high school history education."
