What an adorable story! The melting bubbles also melt my heart. The innocence overflows the screen and also constantly overflows from my eyes. The boy's voice, clear and firm; the girl's fearless determination; they both exhibit a rare charm of independently crafted individuality, not relying on attractive appearances to easily capture the viewer's heart. In the world created by Hayao Miyazaki, there is always profound human culture and friction with nature. There is always a world setting that children can understand yet is not child's play. The view is expansive, and it is fascinating. In the jungle of film and TV filled with all kinds of flashy entertainment, this pure feeling is truly unique.
