Such a cute story, hearts melting like bubbles, also melting my own heart. Innocence spills from the screen and frequently from my eyes too. The boy's voice is clear and firm, the girl's headstrong bravery and decisiveness embody a rarely seen patience in crafting an individual's inherent charisma, never relying on just a pleasing appearance to easily capture the audience's heart. In the world created by Hayao Miyazaki, there is always a profound connection and friction between human culture and nature, always a setting that even children can understand yet is never trivial. In a landscape crowded with dazzling, competitive entertainment, this pure feeling truly stands alone.
