Originally, I thought that safely delivering the lychees to the capital would ensure my unlimited career prospects, and that I should be very happy. However, after traveling this path, I’ve realized that the closer I get to success, the fewer friends I have, and the more guilt I feel. I intended to endure as before, perhaps quickly adapting as usual. But on June 1st, as I leaned against the ruins of Shanghaifang, watching the lychees being carried into Chunming Gate, I realized I wasn’t happy at all; only filled with utter disgust.
