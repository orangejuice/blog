I initially thought that successfully delivering the lychees to the capital would yield boundless career opportunities, and that I would be overcome with joy. But along the way, I discovered that the closer I got to success, the fewer friends I had, and the guiltier I felt. I wanted to continue hiding my feelings and endure without complaint, hoping that I might soon get used to it. Yet on the first of June, leaning against the ruined tablet in Shanghao Square, watching the lychees being carried through the Spring Bright Gate, I found myself not at all happy, only filled with revulsion.
