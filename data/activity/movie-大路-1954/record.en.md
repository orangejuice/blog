The cruelty and suffering of life, the disappearance without a trace in death, that is the true face of the world. An outstanding performance. The year 1954. It makes me wonder, what kind of films would people in BC make, what about people in AD 1000, and what about those in AD 3000? Suffering is eternal, if one day people forget about suffering, they will definitely not be happy.
