The cruelty of life and the traceless disappearance of death, this is the true face of the world. A brilliant performance. 1954. It inevitably makes me wonder, what kind of movies would people in the BC era make? What about the people in the year 1000? What about in the year 3000? Pain is eternal. If one day people forget pain, they certainly won't be happy.
