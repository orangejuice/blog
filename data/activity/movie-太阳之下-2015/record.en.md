They have no choice but to comply, methodically performing the tasks assigned to them to secure their basic needs, knowing that their benefactor can take everything away if they displease him. For the performers, the harsh reality is softened in the act of performing, where they get a glimpse of easy and gentle living. The film also reflects a common aspiration among human beings: to care for the weak, to enjoy a sense of equality, to be treated kindly, to lead a light and happy life, to be educated with tolerance and respect. But once the camera turns away, life goes on as before, enduring silently the dangerous thoughts kept hidden within. Watching this film, I am reminded of a great cruelty in the world, and it points to a deep-seated evil that modern and future civilizations are striving to correct. Often times, even a beautiful face does not belong to oneâ€™s self.
