They have no choice but to be manipulated, earnestly completing the tasks given to them in order to obtain shelter, food, and clothing, as everything can be taken away in an instant to the displeasure of those above, because it is all granted by the mercy of the Marshal. For the performers, it seems relentless; they glimpse a gentle and easy life through the performance. It also confirms that all vulnerable human individuals have the same hopes and expectations: to care for the vulnerable, equality in status, to be treated gently, to live a happy and easy life, and to be educated with tolerance and respect. However, once the camera turns away, life continues as usual, stifling dangerous thoughts and silently enduring. Watching this film also makes me acutely aware of a great cruelty in humanity, which is the malice in human nature that modern and future civilizations try to amend. Often, a pretty face no longer belongs to oneself.
