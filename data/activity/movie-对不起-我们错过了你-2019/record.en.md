It's so distressing to watch that any language seems demeaning in the face of such merciless and miserable lives. Life and living here seem heavier than ever. Is there a way out? Where is it? Fortunately, the film cuts abruptly, sparing us the dread of imagining what comes next. But in reality, is there such a timely relief? The future looks bleak, undisciplined children adding to the trouble, manipulative, selfish bosses who say it's all for your good. Yet, we continue to get up and work. Life feels like a march towards the gallows. And before reaching the gallows, we comfort ourselves that everything will get better.
