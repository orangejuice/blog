I bought the book 'Impressions from the Macartney Embassy to China' around 2020, but I only started reading it last August. It's fantastic!! It discusses Qianlong's eunuchs, Heshen, and a military officer, and covers observations in cities like Tianjin, Beijing, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou, along with personal conclusions and analyses. It addresses treatments for sexually transmitted diseases given to Heshen and various Qing imperial officers, even detailing what kind of underwear the Qing government officials wore, and the relationship status between the laboring people and government officials… I fully acknowledge their perceptivity, analytical ability, and summary skills; their thought process starts from correct, absolute realities.... They were all Christians....

In this private journal, he also noted down in music notation a piece he heard among the mainland's folk, which is the melody of 'Jasmine Flower.' He mentioned that this tune was very captivating and because of his unfamiliarity with music notation, he only roughly recorded it.... I suspect this song became widely spread in Europe and America because of this journal’s publication (1804)....
