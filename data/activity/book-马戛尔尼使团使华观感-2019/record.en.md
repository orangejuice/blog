I bought this book 'Macartney Mission's Impressions of China' around 2020, but didn't start reading it until August last year, and it's fascinating!! It talks about the eunuchs of Qianlong, He Shen and a military officer, and narrates various phenomena that they observed in places such as Tianjin, Beijing, Hangzhou and Guangzhou, as well as their own summaries and analyses. It addresses the treatment of venereal diseases of He Shen and other officials of the Qing government, how the officials' underwear is worn, and the state of relationship between the working people and the governmental officials. I highly appreciate their observational, thinking, and summarizing abilities. Their thinking starts from the right point, from the perspective of absolute existence... They are all Christians... 

In this private diary, he also recorded with staves a song he heard among Chinese folk, which is the melody of 'Jasmine Flower'. He said the song was very pleasing and touched him, so he roughly noted it down using the unfamiliar staff notation... I guess the wide spread of this song in Europe and America is due to the publication of this diary (1804)...
