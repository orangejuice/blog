via tw @停云 A line from Amichai struck me for a long time: Those who leave completely//are brought back home in the evening, like found change. We were all once fresh, plump berries, serving day by day in this world, being peeled, juiced, discarded, becoming increasingly humble, useless. It's depressing to read, but that's the fact.
