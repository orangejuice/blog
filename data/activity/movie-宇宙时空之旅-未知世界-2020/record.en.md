A mix of philosophy and technology, a touch of the past and the future, filled with the romance of science. The ending is exceedingly romantic! The script occasionally veers into the excessively romantic, almost literary, with its subtlety, interjections, and resonance. But who cares, just witnessing these unprecedented sights is satisfying enough.
