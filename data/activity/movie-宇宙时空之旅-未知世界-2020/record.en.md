A bit philosophical, a bit techie, a bit past, a bit future, full of scientific romance. The ending is also incredibly romantic! The drama script is organized a bit too romantically, almost like literature, with subtlety, flashbacks, and echoes. Who cares, just watching these unprecedented views is very satisfying.
