Via tg Douban Picks I have always been curious about how Mr. Masayoshi Sato managed to liaise with CCTV back then. How exactly did a national TV station brazenly decide not to spend a penny, yet asked a young foreigner to borrow 3.5 billion yen to complete the documentary 'The Yangtze'? And after it was done, this national TV station used his material to produce 25 episodes of 'Tales of the Yangtze', airing them, but not even mentioning Mr. Sato's name in the credits? Did they even pay him any royalties? Mr. Masayoshi Sato, a talented singer-songwriter, had to perform small concerts every other day to pay off his debts, which he finally cleared after 30 years.
