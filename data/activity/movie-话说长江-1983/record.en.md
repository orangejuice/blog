Via tg Douban Picks, over the years, I have been very curious about how Mr. Masashi Sada negotiated with CCTV back then. How did a national television station, with thick skin, not spend a penny to let a young man from a foreign land borrow 3.5 billion yen to complete the documentary “Yangtze” . The key is that after the person finished shooting, this national television station used the individual's materials and edited a 25-episode “Tales of the Yangtze” series. This was broadcasted, but did not even mention the creator's name. I do not know whether they paid the copyright fees or not. Masashi Sada, a talented singer-songwriter, had to hold a small concert every two days to repay his debt, and after singing for 30 years, he finally paid off his debts.
