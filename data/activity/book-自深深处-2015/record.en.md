Via Twitter user Douxiaodou: I made a grave psychological mistake: I always thought that conceding in small matters was inconsequential, believing that when significant moments arose, I would reclaim my extraordinary willpower. However, reality proved otherwise; when those moments came, I completely lost my willpower. In life, there are no big or small matters; everything holds the same value. â€” Oscar Wilde, 'De Profundis'
