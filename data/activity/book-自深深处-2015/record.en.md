Via tw Dou Xiaodou I made a huge psychological mistake: I always thought it was unimportant to yield on small matters, and when a major moment arrived, I would exercise excellent willpower again. However, reality is not so, at the crucial moment, I completely lost my willpower. Life actually has no distinction between big and small matters, all things have the same value. â€” Oscar Wilde, 'De Profundis'
