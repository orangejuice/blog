It's a Japanese style of healing; the delicacy of Japanese culture and the stereotype of gender are ever-present. The female characters are adorably innocent and beautifully dressed, with their charming responses and family-oriented attitudes; but they are nonviolent. Any scene that involves violence becomes awkward in this film. One might wonder why such a peculiar sense of healing is formed; during the viewing, it's hard not to think-- it's a very polite and seemingly gentle society, not lacking in care. Are the strict rules, the pressure to conform, the constraint of living in a restricted space, the beautiful cage that one cannot escape, the source of this pain, and hence one seeks understanding and gentle guidance from those with higher status? One must keep living. Continue the path that one has chosen. Keep going. No matter if it's taming or not, it is indeed a genuine wish for your wellbeing, perhaps this is one of the elements of this unique sense of healing. What's sadder is that I was hoping to derive a sense of healing from it, and indeed I have. Regardless of whether it is a diversion of attention or whatever, the entangled softness within is slightly untangled. Life is painfully tedious, there's no escape, one has to cheerfully add some sunshine to oneself. If you don't want to die, what else can you do? This might be the second factor.
