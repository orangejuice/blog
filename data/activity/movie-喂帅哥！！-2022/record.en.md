A Japanese healing experience, filled with the delicacy and gender stereotypes typical of Japanese culture—lovable, snow-white females prominently displaying their bodies, being adorably clueless, or screaming sharply, listening and caring for home, yet never resorting to violence. What appears to be scenes of action are the most awkward in this movie. I wonder why such a peculiar sense of healing arises while watching it—it feels like a society that is very polite and gentle on the surface, not devoid of empathy. The strict rules, societal pressure, confinement in limited spaces, a beautiful but inescapable cage that inflicts trauma, thus seeking counsel and sympathy from those perceived higher in status. We need to keep living, following the path we've chosen. Keep pushing. Even if it's domestication, it genuinely wishes for your wellbeing—it's one of the elements that creates this unique sense of healing. Sadly, I sought healing from it and indeed found it. Whether it’s a distraction or something else, the tangled softness inside me eased a bit. Living a life that is painfully trapped, we can only cheerfully add some sunshine for ourselves. If not wanting to die, what else can we do? This is another contributing factor.
