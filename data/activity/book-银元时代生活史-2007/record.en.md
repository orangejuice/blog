Via Twitter, Mr. Old Cat: 'History of Life in the Silver Yuan Era' consists of serialized remembrances in a Hong Kong newspaper describing life in 1930s Shanghai. The author is a doctor named Chen Cunren. Over 20 years ago, when this book was published in China, I bought a copy and it became one of my favorite leisure reads for several years, always flipping through it whenever I had the chance. If you want to understand the real conditions of old Shanghai, this book is perhaps the most vivid and authentically rooted in everyday life that I have encountered.
