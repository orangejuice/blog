Via tw Xu Laomao, 'The Silver Dollar Era: A History of Life' is a series of texts recalling life in Shanghai in the 1930s, serialized in Hong Kong newspapers in the mid to late last century, written by a doctor named Chen Cunren. I bought a copy of this book when it was published in China more than 20 years ago, and it has become my favorite leisure reading over the years, flipping through it whenever I have time. If you want to understand the real situation of old Shanghai, this book is almost the most vivid and most grounded in daily life I have seen.
