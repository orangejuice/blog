---

Lovely Leslie Cheung and Chow Yun-Fat, this is a memorable era of Hong Kong cinema. Intense gunfights, clear distinctions between good and evil, chivalrous heroes, immortal aura, and pure beauties. Dreams within dreams, emotions within emotions, a criminal universe free from worldly attachments, distinctly unique.
