      comment: Via Twitter StopCloud French Sinologist Jacques Gernet's 'Everyday Life
        in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion,' depicts Hangzhou in its
        most glorious moment in Chinese history. The book includes the noise and
        elegance of urban life in Hangzhou at the end of the Southern Song
        Dynasty, the daily routines of emperors, generals, and the common people
        as dictated by the seasons, the high standards of aesthetic appreciation
        in painting and the arts, and more. But this ukiyo-e-like Hangzhou, does
        it seem overly beautiful and romantic because of its distant location?

An excellent introductory historical reading, the translation is authentic, making people forget that they are reading a foreign original. The choice of viewpoint is unparalleled, leveraging a plethora of Song Dynasty legacies to revive the splendid landscape of Hangzhou on the eve of the fall of a pinnacle of Chinese civilization. The cultural environment, class attributes, state governance, and intellectual thought, after a millennium of evolution, what remains for us today? The myriad outcomes and mistakes over a millennium of operation of ancient Chinese society shape today's society. The world is hurried and busy, who has the leisure to care about the living conditions of people who died a thousand years ago? But here lies many roots of the mentality of today's Chinese people, as well as clues to changes in institutional culture. The translator's notes at the end are stark with a chill, filled with sorrow.
