      comment: "Via Twitter: French sinologist Xie Henai's 'China's Daily Life on the
        Eve of the Mongol Invasion' recounts the glory days of Hangzhou city in
        Chinese history. The book describes the hustle, elegance, daily lives of
        emperors, officials, and commoners through the seasons in late Southern
        Song's Hangzhou, as well as the high aesthetic in painting and artifact
        art. And this ukiyo-e-like Hangzhou, does its distant past make it seem
        too beautiful and romantic?"

A very excellent introductory historical text, authentically translated, making one forget the work is originally in a foreign language. The choice of perspective is unparalleled, using numerous legacies from the late Song dynasty to revive the peak moments of Chinese civilization just before its collapse in Hangzhou. It explores human environments, class attributes, state governance, and spiritual thought; after a thousand years of evolution, what remains for us today? The outcomes and mistakes of ancient Chinese society over thousands of years shape today's society, though people are too busy and anxious to pay attention to the lives of those long gone. However, here lies the roots of today's national mentality and clues to cultural and systemic changes. The translator's note at the end highlights a sense of poignancy, filled with sorrow.
