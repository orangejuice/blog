Expectations were high, but disappointment was even greater. It's a thoroughly commercial film, with a heap of exquisitely shallow images, deliberately driven conflicts, and forcefully shaped character growth. It prioritizes character appearance and political correctness, while trifling with the ideal of connotative value. There is no sign of any intention to create an educational film for the pursuit of a better goal. On the contrary, the powerless speeches and the value conveyed by the film itself are hinting that the producers do not care about some people's high hopes at all, but just face the controversy faced by Barbie, mesh the hotspots, and try to "clear its name", to please the audience. This kind of behaviour of exploiting the public's weakness to ensure benefits, and the disdain for human values under it, makes me feel the same discomfort as the widespread popularity of short videos. https://movie.douban.com/review/15324290/
