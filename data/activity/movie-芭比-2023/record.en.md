High expectations, higher disappointment. A thorough commercial film featuring superficial aesthetics and manufactured conflicts and character growth. It prioritizes attractiveness and political correctness over substantial values and ideals. There's no sign of striving for a meaningful educational piece, quite the contrary. Weak monologues and the value conveyed by the film suggest that the producers do not care about the expectations some people might hold. Instead, amid the controversies surrounding Barbie, it blends trending topics and tries to seek approbation by "redeeming" Barbie. This exploitation of public vulnerabilities for profit, and the concomitant disregard for human value, gives me the same discomfort that is widespread with short video popularity.
