Via Twitter, Xu Laomao: We spend too much time worrying about the future, fretting about the past, and not enough time focusing on the most important people and things in the present. We are almost always in this deadly mental consumption. 'The Power of Now' tells you that every minute spent worrying about the future or regretting the past is a wasted minute. What you need is to learn to live in the present. This is a book that offers new insights and heals mental consumption every time you read it.
