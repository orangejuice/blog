Via Twitter user Old Cat Xu, we spend too much time worrying about the future, dwelling on the past, and having no time to focus on the most important people and things in the present. We are almost always trapped in this deadly mental exhaustion. 'The Power of Now' tells you that every minute spent worrying about the future or regretting the past is a wasted minute. What you need to learn is to live in the present. This is a good book that can generate new insights and heal mental exhaustion every time you flip through it.
