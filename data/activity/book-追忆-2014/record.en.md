(Via Twitter Proper Hoodlum In the 18th-century novel 'Dream of the Red Chamber', many of the main characters are unaware of their own destinies, this kind of obliviousness has a certain charm.) The book is academically strong, discussing the phenomenon in Chinese literature of valuing the past and history.
