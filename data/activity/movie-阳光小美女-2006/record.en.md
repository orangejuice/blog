It's a comedy with some thoughtful little ideas. Nevertheless, it’s a very light-hearted comedy. The father’s performance is quite competent; perhaps one could learn how to make expressions from him? His expressions are so rich and accurately conveyed. The ending's stage performance was truly unexpected. It’s curious why this film gained such popularity.
