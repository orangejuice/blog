It's a comedy, with some small ideas in it. But still, it's a very relaxed comedy. The father's acting was quite satisfactory, maybe you can learn to make expressions? The expressions were so rich and accurate. The final stage performance was really unexpected. Don't know why this movie got quite popular.
