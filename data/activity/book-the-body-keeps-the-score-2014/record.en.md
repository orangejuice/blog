Via tw laojiang2010 More and more people around me are traumatized, so I bought this book to learn about it. Some content is too heavy and the information is quite dense, so I've been reading it intermittently for over a month. Among the books I've read this year, this is the only one that has taught me a lot and made me think a lot.
