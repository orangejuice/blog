Via Twitter user @laojiang2010: More and more people around me are suffering from trauma, so I bought this book to learn about it. Some content is too heavy, and the information is quite dense; it took me over a month to read intermittently. Of all the books I've read this year, this is the only one that taught me a lot and made me think a lot.
