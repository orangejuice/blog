  title: The Body Keeps the Score
  subtitle: Bessel van der Kolk, MD / 2014 / Viking Adult
  intro: >-
    A pioneering researcher and one of the world's foremost experts on traumatic
    stress offers a bold new paradigm for healing

    Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful
    aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four
    grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical
    violence. Such experiences inevitably leave traces on minds, emotions, and
    even on biology. Sadly, trauma sufferers frequently pass on their stress to
    their partners and children.

    Renowned trauma expert Bessel van der Kolk has spent over three decades
    working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he transforms our
    understanding of traumatic stress, revealing how it literally rearranges the
    brain's wiring-specifically areas dedicated to pleasure, engagement,
    control, and trust. He shows how these areas can be reactivated through
    innovative treatments including neurofeedback, mindfulness techniques, play,
    yoga, and other therapies. Based on Dr. van der Kolk's own research and that
    of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score offers proven
    alternatives to drugs and talk therapy-and a way to reclaim lives.

Via tw laojiang2010 身边越来越多有创伤的人，于是买来这本书了解一下。有些内容太沉重，信息也比较密集，断断续续看了一个多月。今年看的书中，目前这是唯一一本让我学到了很多也思考很多的。
