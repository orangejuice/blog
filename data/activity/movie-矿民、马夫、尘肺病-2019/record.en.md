The film is excruciating to watch. It paints the pains of mere existence, the agony of social abandonment, and the torment of persisting through such a merciless life. Every character embodies an unspeakable suffering that drowns me, leads me to question our times, and compels me to deeply ponder where exactly things have gone wrong.
