Watching it, I feel it's too harsh. The pain of just being alive, the pain of being forsaken by society, the pain of enduring despite the pain. Everyone carries inexpressible suffering. This suffering overwhelmed me, making me doubt this era, making me especially want to think seriously about what exactly went wrong.
