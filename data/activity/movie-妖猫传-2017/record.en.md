I knew I would be disappointed, but I still went to see it because of the legendary Tang Dynasty settings. Still disappointed. I watched two hours of boring special effects piled up, clich√©d shows of special effects, lighting, and music. Rarely logical, whimsically performed, maddeningly awkward, and feigned tension. The color grading of the entire film is dull and uninteresting, constantly breaking the immersion. The ending is terrible, featuring a petulant pretty boy. The portrayal of Yang Yuhui is bland and boring. The only decent aspect was the imaginative depiction of the Paradise Banquet, slightly revealing an artistic vision. I do not consider it a passable work.
