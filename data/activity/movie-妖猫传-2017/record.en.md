Perhaps knew in advance that it would disappoint, but still came for the rumored Tang Dynasty backdrop. Nonetheless, it was disappointing. After watching two hours of boring special effects stacking and trite light sitcoms, the film seldom follows any logical thread and is an almost arbitrary depiction that’s embarrassingly pretentious and attempts to feign tension. The film’s color tuning is flat and dull, constantly distracting the audience. Even the ending is lame, ending up in a milk-toast protesting. The portrayal of Yang Yuhuan is also one-dimensional and boring. The only redeeming aspect is the imagination and depiction of the feast of Elysium, where a bit of artistic imagination was shown. I don’t think it’s a passing work.
