Finished reading on May 3, the text is very comfortable. A restrained and interesting childhood perspective innocently records the bleak reality. The influence of family elders on the next generation's values and perspectives emerges in the careless text, vividly presenting the lives of the common people during the extremely impoverished and closed period of Imperial China, remotely echoing the blurry snippets of childhood from the 1990s. In this book, I found a fulcrum linking the past and present of society.
