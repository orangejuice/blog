Finished reading on May 3, the text is very comfortable. Restrained and interesting childhood perspective, innocently recording the bleak reality. The influence of family elders on the values and vision of the next generation emerges in casual words. These ordinary people living in the extremely poor and closed imperial China are vivid and are vaguely echoed with the fragments glimpsed in the 90s of my childhood memories. Found the fulcrum linking the past and the present of society in the book.
