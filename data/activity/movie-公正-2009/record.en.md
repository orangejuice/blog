The content is so rich, but having watched it once, it almost feels like I haven't watched it at all. Perhaps someday I'll return to really chew it over. Sigh, there's so much good out there, but life is so quick and fleeting. I must seem too young, having these thoughts. When can I ever calmly savour every second of life's splendour?
