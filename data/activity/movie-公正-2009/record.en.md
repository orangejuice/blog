The content is so rich, yet after watching it just once, it feels as if I haven't watched it at all. It's time to come back and chew on it again. Alas, there are too many good things, and life is too brief and rushed. I must be too young to feel this way, longing for the time when I can calmly savor every brilliant second of life.
