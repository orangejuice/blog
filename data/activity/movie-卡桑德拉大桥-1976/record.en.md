Via tw zhu yun he The Cassandra Crossing, people around 40 years old should still remember this movie. I was only 4 or 5 years old when I watched it, and I remembered the beautiful leading lady and a line: 'The virus self-depletes in high concentrations of oxygen, and the people in the car have recovered.' '...Things have been decided, they still have to cross that bridge.'
