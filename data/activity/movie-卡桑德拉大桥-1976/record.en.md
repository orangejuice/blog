Via tw zhu yun he The Cassandra Crossing, people around the age of 40 should still remember this film. I was only about 4 or 5 years old when I watched this movie and remembered the beautiful female lead, along with a line of dialog:
"The virus consumes itself in high concentrations of oxygen, and the people in the car have already recovered."
"...It's already decided, they still have to cross that bridge."
