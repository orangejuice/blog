The female character's scenes are too spectacular, with thin character images and outlines, the credibility of the story and plot development is too low. The image of the respectable, invincible police lurking behind the scenes is indescribable. However, it must be said that 'Uncle Ge', Andy Lau, and Rene Liu have performed this thin plot very touchingly, and Fan Wei's whimsical jokes were adorably irreplaceable. Li Bingbing has been lurking in the film industry for a long time.
