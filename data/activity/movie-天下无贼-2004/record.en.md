The female roles are too glamorous; the character build and outline are too simplistic, and the story's development and plot credibility are quite low. Wei Guangzheng's hidden invincible police character is indescribable. Yet, it must be said that 'Uncle Ge' Andy Lau and Rene Liu made this thin plot very touching. Also, Fan Wei's immortal humor is unbearably cute. Li Bingbing has indeed been through countless film sets.
