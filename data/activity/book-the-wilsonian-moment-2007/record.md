  title: The Wilsonian Moment
  subtitle: Erez Manela / 2007 / Oxford University Press
  intro: During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, while key decisions were
    debated by the victorious Allied powers, a multitude of smaller nations and
    colonies held their breath, waiting to see how their fates would be decided.
    President Woodrow Wilson, in his Fourteen Points, had called for "a free,
    open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims,"
    giving equal weight would be given to the opinions of the colonized peoples
    and the colonial powers. Among those nations now paying close attention to
    Wilson's words and actions were the budding nationalist leaders of four
    disparate non-Western societies--Egypt, India, China, and Korea. That
    spring, Wilson's words would help ignite political upheavals in all four of
    these countries. This book is the first to place the 1919 Revolution in
    Egypt, the Rowlatt Satyagraha in India, the May Fourth movement in China,
    and the March First uprising in Korea in the context of a broader "Wilsonian
    moment" that challenged the existing international order. Using primary
    source material from America, Europe, and Asia, historian Erez Manela tells
    the story of how emerging nationalist movements appropriated Wilsonian
    language and adapted it to their own local culture and politics as they
    launched into action on the international stage. The rapid disintegration of
    the Wilsonian promise left a legacy of disillusionment and facilitated the
    spread of revisionist ideologies and movements in these societies; future
    leaders of Third World liberation movements - Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and
    Jawaharlal Nehru, among others - were profoundly shaped by their experiences
    at the time. The importance of the Paris Peace Conference and Wilson's
    influence on international affairs far from the battlefields of Europe
    cannot be underestimated. Now, for the first time, we can clearly see just
    how the events played out at Versailles sparked a wave of nationalism that
    is still resonating globally today.
