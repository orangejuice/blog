A superficial introduction with unclear logical development. Instead of telling the story well, it focuses too much on sensationalism. The repeated use of scenes made me question how many of the film segments truly correspond to the historical events discussed. Overall, it appears somewhat cheap, and it's hard to say how much effort was put into making this film. It's also hard to say how much interest this film could arouse among viewers.
