A superficial introduction, the development logic is not clearly reflective, too busy stirring emotions without properly telling the story, repeated scene use makes me question how much film and television footage corresponds to the historical events described. Overall it comes off as a bit cheap, it's hard to say how much effort was put into making this film, it's hard to say how much interest this film could rouse in the audience.
