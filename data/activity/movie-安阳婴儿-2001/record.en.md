Produced at very low cost, but the story is complete and interesting. The particularly rough camera language, the noise throughout the film, combined with especially poor quality images, brings a very different experience. The actual scene documents a northern small town in the 2000s, and the Yin dynasty ruins in Henan Anyang are the most attractive places for me.
