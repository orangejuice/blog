Produced on a very low budget, yet the storyline is complete and interesting. The film features particularly rough camera work and pervasive noise throughout, combined with poor image quality resources, which provides a unique experience. It realistically documents a northern small town from the 2000s, Anyang in Henan â€” a place rich with remnants from the Shang Dynasty, which is the most captivating aspect for me.
