Via Twitter @DouXiaoDou: 'Do not despair, nor even despair over the fact that 'you are not despairing.' When everything seems bleak, as if the mountains and rivers are exhausted, and the heavens are about to forsake humanity, a new power spontaneously emerges from within your heart to aid you. And that means you are still alive.' / Via Twitter @DouXiaoDou 'Sleep, wake, sleep, wake, such is the poor life.'
