Via tw Dou XiaoDou. Do not despair, nor even despair because of the fact that you are not in despair. When everything seems to be at a standstill and the sky is about to turn against people, a new force emerges from your heart to help you. That means you are still alive. / Via tw Dou XiaoDou 'Sleep, wake, sleep, wake, poor life.'
