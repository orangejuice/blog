Via Douban user Niu Niu Niu borrowed a book called 'How to Deal with Difficult People' from the library, the author is German Karen Miller. Originally, I just wanted to refer to it on how to handle things at work, but I hadn't expected that the second half of this book directly hit my problem, showing me my own patterns of being angered. Simply put, I had many experiences in my early life of emotional suppression, degradation, and hurt.
