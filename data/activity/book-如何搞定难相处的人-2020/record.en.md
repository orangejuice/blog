Via douban Niu Niu Niu borrowed the book 'How to Deal with Difficult People' from the library, authored by German Karen MÃ¼ller. Initially intended as a reference for handling work-related matters, the latter half of the book directly hit a sore spot in me, making me see my own patterns of getting provoked. In simple terms, I experienced a lot of emotional suppression, belittlement, and hurt in my early years.
