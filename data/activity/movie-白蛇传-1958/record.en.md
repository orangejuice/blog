(Restored Version) A highly imaginative adaptation blurring the lines between truth and fiction, reality and the mythical world, as well as between the original work and its adaptation—a mix of Chinese and Japanese cultures. Charming and lively, the animation boasts richly detailed movements, a fresh and gentle style, authentically Eastern in its charm, with touches of Japanese expressions. For 1958 animation, it's so effortlessly executed, displaying great comfort and skill. The animal kingdom's survival of the fittest, where might makes right, is somewhat poignantly realistic. The imagery of the panda and its dominating plot makes me think there's a deeper significance. The happy ending where except for Lady White turning into a human form, everyone else returns to their normal lives, and Fahai finally sees the error of his ways. A battle to the death is inevitable—will love or hatred prevail?
