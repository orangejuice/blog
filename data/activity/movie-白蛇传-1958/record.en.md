(Restored version) An imaginative adaptation, truth and falsehood mixed together, a fusion of the real world and the mythical, an amalgam of the original and the adapted, as well as a blend of Chinese and Japanese cultures. Charming and sprightly, the detailed movements are abundant, the style is refreshing and gentle, and the background captures the authentic charm of the East, with a touch of Japanese expressiveness. This 1958 animation already feels so effortless and adept. The survival of the fittest among the animated creatures, where might makes right, is somewhat heartrending in its realism. The imagery of the panda, and its reigning subplot, seem to hint at hidden meanings. In the happy reunion at the end, apart from the White Lady becoming human, everyone else returns to their old lives, and Fahai has a change of heart. We are forced into a fight to the death. Which side will win, my undying love or your endless hatred?
