Composed elegance, restrained sophistication, emotional depth akin to a hymn celebrating innocence and laudation of life. Expressive eyes and actions speak volumes where words fall short. The silent arrival of love brings along responsibilities, growth, strength and gives rise to life. From awkward moments to tortuous ones; from highlights to moments of starting afresh; recalling and letting go ...companionship and solitude, unity and departure, patience and perseverance... Keeping one's innocence and goodness intact, respecting destiny, accepting life & death, tolerating the grotesque, cherishing the beautiful, dreams are not meant to be tormenting. Adore this robot with eyes clear and sparkling with naive exuberance, love the September tune hummed by the robot in its dream.
