Calm and graceful, subtle and restrained, deeply moving, it is a song that extols kindness and innocence, a poem that praises life. A look, an expression, or an action can reveal more than words ever could. Love arrives silently, carrying responsibilities, fostering growth, providing strength, and nurturing life. Awkward moments, times of torment, shining moments, moments of rebeginning, moments of reminiscence, and moments of letting go... Companionship and solitude, gatherings and partings, patience and persistence... Maintain innocence, keep kindness, honor fate, accept life and death, forgive the ugly, enjoy the beauty, dream without pain. Deeply in love with this na√Øve and pure-eyed robot, and the song 'September' it hums in its dreams.
