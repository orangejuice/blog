via tw @tinyfool Pure intellectual power is intelligence, which is the ability to understand and apply complex concepts and ideas. However, intelligence can also be enslaved by concepts and ideas, leading to erroneous conclusions and unwise actions. This may be discovered after considering all relevant factors, including those cleverly excluded by intellectual constructs. Karl Marx's 'Das Kapital' is a classic case, where it is an intellectually masterful exposition of a fundamentally flawed concept. Specifically, the erroneous notion presented in 'Das Kapital' is that 'labor' (i.e., the physical processing of raw materials) and the means of production are the true sources of wealth. If Marx's notion were true, then countries with many laborers and little technology or entrepreneurial activity would be more prosperous than those with few laborers and much technology or entrepreneurial activity; however, the reality is quite the opposite.
