A very, very special film, with such a bizarre plot that I'm at a loss for words to describe it. Beyond a unique aesthetic, it features macabre humor, curious twists, and standout reversals, with intensely oppressive moments that nearly made me want to stop watching. A mix of elements creates a twisted, eerie, and tragically beautiful world. The ending is heartbreaking for the male lead, which made me feel deeply for him. And then there are the bottles and jars on the shelf. Such cruel punishments are almost too much to bear when seen. Having watched it, I feel incredibly conflicted. The perverse behavior displayed was so shocking that it momentarily made me unable to return to the reality around me and lose hope for the future of humanity. Yet, on reflection, these are realities that exist in society, whether I am aware of them or not; there are even crueller, more perverse atrocities out there. Whether I know it or not, whether I am ignorant or more informed, it does not impact the fate of humanity; hope exists as it did, and hopelessness persists as it did. I can only comfort myself and let go.
