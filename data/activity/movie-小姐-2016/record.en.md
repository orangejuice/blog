This is a very very special film. The bizarre plot leaves me at a loss for words. Aside from its unique beauty, it excels in its macabre, eccentricity, and narrative twists. The suspenseful parts are indeed suspenseful â€” so much so, they almost made me want to give up on watching. All these elements mixed together create a twisted, eerie, yet beautiful world. I felt truly sorry for the male lead at the end of it all. Not forgetting the bottles and jars on the shelves. Such cruel punishment is so horrifying that it could make one break down instantly. Upon finishing the movie, my emotions were incredibly complex. These perverse behaviors made me momentarily unable to return to reality and lose hope in the future of mankind. Thinking it over though, such things truly exist in society, and whether I know of them or not, they hold a cruel constant presence, maybe even to worse extents. Regardless of whether I am ignorant or aware, it does not influence the fate of humanity. If there is hope, there will still be hope; without any, there will still be none. All I can do is console myself and move on.
