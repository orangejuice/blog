Via tw Stop Cloud, this is the best observation note of foreigners by a Chinese in these two years, about the economic, political and cultural writing of a country could be quite dry, however, Wang Bang with her abundant knowledge and exceptional sense of words filled this book with fresh textures. It feels like a talk show that talks about serious topics but makes people laugh again and again, and also contains sober reflections on here and there, asking why our environment doesn't breed the same mechanism?
