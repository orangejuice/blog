Via Twitter by Tingyun - This is the best Chinese observation notes I've read on a foreign country in recent years. Discussing a nation's economic, political, and cultural issues could be dry, but Wang Bang, with her abundant intelligence and exceptional literary empathy, infuses the book with a vivid texture. It feels like a stand-up comedy that deals with serious topics yet frequently makes you laugh, and it also offers sober reflections on why our circumstances fail to foster the same mechanisms.
