What I witnessed was the plain, powerless despair of the underdog. The actors were outstanding. Life as it stands is just so bleak, so pitiable, so devoid of hope. Yet having someone you love, to stand unweary and unsensitized with each other before the end, to express and pour out oneâ€™s despair, to enjoy the present with no tomorrow, is indeed a fortunate thing. The use of pixelation was poor, breaking the immersion.
