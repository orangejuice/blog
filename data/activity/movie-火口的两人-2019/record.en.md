What I see is the simple despair of the powerless little people. The actors performed very well. Is not life nowadays just so bleak, so pitiful, so hopeless? Yet to have a loved one who doesn't become tired or numb, who supports each other before the end of the world, who expresses and pours out their own despair, and enjoys the present with no tomorrow, it's quite a fortunate thing. The mosaic technique is bad, it distracts from the experience.
