Four commonly used textbooks in American universities, each with its own brilliance:

"US: A Narrative History"
"American History" by Alan Brinkley
"The American People" by Gary Nash
"Give Me Liberty! An American History" by Eric Foner

If you have never read American history, you can start with this little book. "Yale: A Little History of America" is written for American elementary students, beautifully written and easy to read.
