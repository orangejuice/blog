      comment: "Via Twitter user Lao Bai: Author Simone de Beauvoir is the most famous
        contemporary existentialist writer in France and the lifelong partner of
        renowned philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. This is not a feminist book, but
        rather an enlightening read for women. Unlike many feminists who just
        talk verbally about 'you men, we women,' Beauvoir offers numerous fresh
        perspectives in the book, uncovering what true equality really entails,
        and how women can obtain the maximum liberation. In the face of social
        prejudices and stereotypes, women endure too much irresistible force.
        Unfortunately for her, by the time she realizes she has been deceived,
        it is already too late. When I was reading it, I had one feeling:
        Beauvoir has thoroughly explained everything. If you're not content
        being the second sex, this book will provide the answers you seek. This
        simplified translation is... powerless to critique, I bought the
        original Taiwanese edition for over three hundred, but felt it was
        especially worth it."

Via Twitter user Lao Bai: Author Simone de Beauvoir is the most famous contemporary existentialist writer in France and the lifelong partner of renowned philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.

This is not a feminist book, but rather an enlightening read for women.

Unlike many feminists who only talk: you men, we women, Beauvoir presents many refreshing viewpoints in this book, revealing what true equality is and how women can achieve the greatest degree of liberation.
Via Twitter user Yue Ying:
The great fortune of men lies in the fact that whether in adult life or as a child, they must embark on a very arduous path, a path that is extremely reliable. The misfortune of women lies in being constantly surrounded by irresistible temptations, each thing tempting her to take the easy path, not required to strive upward but told that just sliding down will lead her to the paradise of bliss. When she realizes that she has been fooled by the mirage, it is already too late, her strength drained through repeated pleasures.
