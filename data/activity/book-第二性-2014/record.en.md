        Via tw Lao Bai. The author, Simone de Beauvoir, is one of the most
        famous existentialist writers in contemporary France, the lifelong
        companion of renowned philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. 


        This is not a feminist book, but an enlightening read for women. 


        Unlike many feminists who just talk about 'you men, we women', Beauvoir
        offers numerous refreshing perspectives in this book and reveals what
        true equality is, and how women can achieve the maximum degree of
        liberation. 


        Under social prejudice and stereotypes, women endure too much
        unstoppable force, and the misfortune of a woman is that, by the time
        she realizes she has been fooled, it's already too late. 


        When I read it, I had one feeling: Beauvoir elucidates everything. 


        If you're not content being 'the second sex,' this book will give you
        the answers you're seeking. 


        As for the translation of this simplified Chinese version...no words, as
        I bought the Taiwanese original translated edition. It cost me more than
        three hundred, but I feel it's worth it.

Via tw Yue Ying. Men are extremely fortunate for, whether in adulthood or childhood, they must embark on a very arduous path, which is also incredibly reliable. The misfortune of women lies in that they are always surrounded by irresistible temptations. Everything is enticing them to take the easier path. They're not asked to strive upwards but are told that as long as they slide down, they can reach paradise. By the time they realize they've been deceived by a mirage, it's far too late, as their strength has been exhausted by repeated pleasures.
