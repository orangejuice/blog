A superb full-length piece, watched in one sitting. Life is a long, gentle stream of mediocrity, an inescapable sorrow, forever ordinary and unremarkable. To live is also to die, to gain is also to lose. Having nothing, exchanging body and dignity for a fragile love or a dream, then having nothing again. Love and dreams, for ordinary people, are as rare and precious as a chance encounter with a peacock spreading its feathers, while the privileged can keep two in their yard. Those bottom layer workers, migrant workers, street vendors, living in broken houses, tube buildings, collective dormitories are just the ubiquitous unknown majority, their futures consumed by sick relatives, gazing neighbors, and demeaning jobs. The southern blue bricks and green tiles, flowing water, still add a lively and harmonious touch to life, adding a bit of animation and festivity. From the comments section, a statement about "children with a rich inner world and sensitive to criticism always seem startlingly unpredictable" lingers in the mind.
