A great long film, watched in one take. Life is a calm and gentle stream, an inescapable sadness, an eternal plainness. To want to live, yet to live is to die, to want to gain, yet to gain is to lose. Having nothing, swapping the body and dignity for a chance of fragile love or dreams, then again having nothing. Love and dreams, for ordinary people it's as rare and precious as witnessing a peacock's spreading its tail. Whereas the high-class can keep a couple in their yard. These sweatshop workers, farmers, those selling on the streets, living in run-down houses and apartment blocks, in dormitories, they are those anonymous majority. Their future is consumed by sick relatives, staring neighbors, and low down jobs. Southern scene of green-bricked red-tiled roofs in a landscape of flowing streams does add a bit of bustling color to life, and a touch of tranquility amidst the swirling smoke and fire. A comment in the comment section saying "Sensitive and overly enriched inner world children are always unpredictable in the future." deeply resonate.
