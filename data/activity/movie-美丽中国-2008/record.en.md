Finally watched this film. It was not fully satisfying. It mentioned a lot of topics but mostly just glossed over them without any in-depth exploration attempting to touch the essence. There was not much of a deep impression left after watching. However, if you want to see China's landscape, this film probably can do a good job. But some shots and narratives did not achieve the best matching effect, and there was a feeling of insufficient shooting time and scenes being put together forcefully. During the screening, this could be immediately felt. The last episode did present an intriguing fact: the rise in carbon dioxide levels leads to more typhoons, which bring plankton from the ocean floor to the surface, thus absorbing more carbon dioxide. Quite astonishing and interesting.
