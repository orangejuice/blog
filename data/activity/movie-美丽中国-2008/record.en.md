Finally watched this movie. It didn't quite satisfy my appetite, mentioning many topics but merely skimming over them without any in-depth discussion or attempt to touch the essence of anything. Almost no lasting impression after watching. However, if one is looking to enjoy the scenery of China, this movie might still be a good choice. But some shots and narratives didn't achieve the best combination, giving a feeling of rushed compilation due to insufficient shooting time, which is immediately noticeable while watching. The last episode did teach me an intriguing bit of trivia: rising CO2 levels cause more typhoons, which bring marine plankton to the surface where they can absorb CO2. Quite astonishing and fun.
