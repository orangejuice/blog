This is not a movie that can be understood right away. It's very artistic, a bit absurd and exaggerated, and has its own unique style. I couldn't immerse myself into the plot, as if that was not the purpose of this movie, but to let you just sit and listen to its story, in its own style. The rhythm is very relaxed.
