This is not a movie that you can understand from the start. It's artistic, a bit absurd and exaggerated, and has a very unique style. I couldn't immerse myself in the plot, which seems not to be the purpose of the movie. Instead, it just lets you sit tight and listen to the story being told in its own style. The pace is relaxed.
