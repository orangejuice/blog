An unexpectedly raw portrayal, with a copious amount of frank, male-perspective descriptions of sexuality. Coupled with the unique imprint of its era, the fact that it got published is notable. The writing style is sophisticated yet uses vulgar, colloquial language that highlights a confident personality. The writer appears well-read, skilled in the craft of storytelling, creating a vivid image of the author: a privileged second-generation youth raised in a high-ranking official's compound, with affluent family background and surrounded by various women. The story setup in 'The Realm of Yin and Yang' borders on male fantasy, where an attractive young woman doesn't mind the ruined reputation of an impotent man living alone in a basement and goes as far as to strip and propose marriage in front of him, which, in light of the author's persona, doesn't seem so far-fetched.
