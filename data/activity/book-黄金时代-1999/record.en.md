An unexpected art style. An explicit, frank depiction of sexuality, largely from a male perspective. Coupled with the unique imprint of the era, it was not easy to get published. The writing flows smoothly, language is crude and colloquial, highlighting a confident personality. The author appears well-read, adept at textual work and storytelling, unconsciously embodying the image of a second-generation youth from a high-ranking official's family, blessed with abundant material and eloquent speech, surrounded by women of all kinds. In the Yin and Yang realms chapter, the story setting is overly male fantasy, where pretty young women donâ€™t mind a basement-dwelling man infamous for impotence, they propose marriage and readily undress themselves, in front of such an author image, it doesn't seem too sudden.
