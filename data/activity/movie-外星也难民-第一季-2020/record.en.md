Struggled through to episode seven just to see how incredible it was. Couldn't appreciate it, as it was overloaded with dense information, possibly suiting the taste of nerds? It felt like it was just about entertainment, consumption, revelry, bombarding the audience into numbness like a barrage of short videos, rushing towards a decaying apocalypse. After watching this, even the Rick and Morty series seems to tell tales smoothly.
