By the time I reached episode 7, I was curious to see how incredible it was. It's not my cup of tea, with all its dense, jam-packed information. Maybe it suits the taste of nerds? All I feel is that it overwhelms with entertainment and consumerism, like a wild carnival or a barrage of short videos that numb the audience. It's rushing toward a decadent doomsday. After seeing this, even the Rick and Morty series feels like a relaxing storytelling journey.
