Such precious footage, I love the feeling from this photographer, capturing your gaze, pondering your soul. I've filled up a lot of the historical distance after watching this not-so-short documentary with mixed feelings. Should it be called history? It doesn't seem so distant. Why has everything changed in appearance, yet when looking closely, there is so much that has not. I can even more delicately imagine the life of my parents at that time. In the end, I also got to watch half a set of acrobatic shows for free.
