Such precious footage! I love the feel of this photographer, capturing your gaze, fathoming your soul. After watching this lengthy documentary full of mixed emotions, it bridges a lot of historical distance. Should it be called history, though? It doesn't seem so far away, yet appearances and everything have changed, yet on closer inspection, much remains the same. It even allows a more delicate imagination of what my parents' lives were like back then. In the end, we even got to watch half a show of acrobatics for free.
