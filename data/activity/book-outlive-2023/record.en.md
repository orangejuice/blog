Via Twitter user 'mindfroge': Peter Attia and Bill Gifford's new English book is described as a new health bible, recommending a paradigm shift in medicine. Traditional medicine, or 'Medicine 2.0', often intervenes when severe health issues arise, while 'Medicine 3.0' incorporates daily practices for prevention and adopts different strategies. The former relies on surgery and medication, while the latter includes exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, drugs, hormones, and supplements. To achieve longevity, one must combat the 'four horsemen of death': cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's). Exercise is highlighted as the most effective longevity medicine, not just any exercise, but those with specific goals like maximizing oxygen uptake (VO2max), a key indicator of longevity. The book also discusses this in 'The Art of the Impossible: Practical Edition'. Protein intake is the most crucial aspect of nutrition, emphasizing the importance of muscle strength. Sleep, often the most overlooked aspect, is also crucial for health. Via Twitter user 'Zutao': Engaging in a dry sauna at least four times a week, for a minimum of twenty minutes at temperatures of 82 degrees Celsius or higher can reduce the risk of Alzheimerâ€™s by approximately 65% and cut the risk of developing arterial plaque by 50%.
