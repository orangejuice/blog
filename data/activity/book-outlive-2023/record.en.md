Through reviewing this new English book, also known as the new bible of health, I recommend exploring this paradigm shift in medicine. Where Medicine 2.0 primarily intervenes when severe issues arise, Medicine 3.0 harmoniously integrates into daily life for prevention and adopts different strategies. The former relies on surgeries and drugs, while the latter includes exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, medication, hormones, and supplements. If one wishes to live longer, one has to conquer the four horsemen of death: cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Exercise is the most effective elixir for longevityâ€”but not just any exercise, there are a few core goals, such as maximum oxygen volume (VO2max), a hallmark of longevity. There are discussions about this in 'The Impossible Craft: Action Edition'. Protein intake is critical in nutrition. Muscular strength is too important. The importance of sleep is usually overlooked. / Via tw Zutao: Sauna sessions at least four times a week, lasting at least twenty minutes each, at temperatures of 82 degrees Celsius or higher, can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's by about 65%, as well as reduce the risk of atherosclerosis by 50%.
