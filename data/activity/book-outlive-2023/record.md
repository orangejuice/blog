  intro: >-
    A groundbreaking manifesto on living better and longer that challenges the
    conventional medical thinking on aging and reveals a new approach to
    preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health, from a visionary
    physician and leading longevity expert


    “One of the most important books you’ll ever read.”—Steven D. Levitt, New
    York Times bestselling author of Freakonomics


    Wouldn’t you like to live longer? And better? In this operating manual for
    longevity, Dr. Peter Attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative
    nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and
    tools for addressing emotional and mental health.


    For all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress
    against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer,
    Alzheimer’s disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with
    treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of
    healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this
    outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity,
    one where we take action now, rather than waiting.


    This is not “biohacking,” it’s science: a well-founded strategic and
    tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical,
    cognitive, and emotional health. Dr. Attia’s aim is less to tell you what to
    do and more to help you learn how to think about long-term health, in order
    to create the best plan for you as an individual. In Outlive, readers will
    discover:


    • Why the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesn’t tell you enough
    about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack.

    • That you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed
    liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging.

    • Why exercise is the most potent pro-longevity “drug”—and how to begin
    training for the “Centenarian Decathlon.”

    • Why you should forget about diets, and focus instead on nutritional
    biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern.

    • Why striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional
    health, could be the ultimate curse of all.


    Aging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not
    set in stone. With the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your
    life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than
    the one before.

Via tw mindfroge 英文新书，新健康圣经，推荐看看医学范式转移。医学2.0出严重问题才介入，医学3.0融入日常生活预防，应对策略不同。前者依靠手术和药物，后者包括运动、营养、睡眠、情绪健康、药物、激素、补充剂。要长寿就要战胜死亡四骑士：癌症、糖尿病、心血管病和神经退行性疾病(如老年痴呆)。运动是最有效的长寿药物。但不是瞎运动，有几个核心目标，比如最大摄氧量(VO2max)，这是长寿的标志。这个《不可能的技艺实战篇》有讲到这个。营养里面蛋白质的摄入是最核心的。肌肉的力量太重要。睡眠的重要性最容易被忽略。 / via tw Zutao 每周至少四次，每次至少二十分钟，温度在82摄氏度或更高的干蒸桑拿可以降低患阿尔茨海默病风险约65%以及降低动脉粥样硬化风险50%。
