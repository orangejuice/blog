via tw Chinese immigration phenomenon 2023-11-10 / via tw Ink left by the left hand Unlike Western colonizers armed with military force, the Chinese, compelled by livelihood, crossed the ocean either to do small businesses or work as servants. Even though they could earn quite a lot of money, some even became millionaires, it was hard for them to attain a political status that matched their economic abilities. Regardless of immigrants from the Song Dynasty, or contemporary immigrants, we seemed to be facing the same questionâ€”how to transform from a guarded stranger to becoming the subject in a foreign country, fully integrated into the local society; or, maintaining a blood connection with our homeland, finding a sense of belonging from relatives there.

In the era of global economic growth, the situation of immigrants wouldn't be affected much. But once the global economy enters full-scale contraction, when competition is increasingly fierce, nationality, race, immigration, and concepts would gradually become the issue, slowly but surely becoming more prominent. This is a problem that foreigners will inevitably have to face in the future (depending on the country they're in, the time of arrival will also differ). 2023-12-23
