via Twitter: Chinese immigration phenomenon 2023-11-10 / via Twitter: Sinister Handwrites Unlike Western Europeans who came with armed forces and colonized, the Chinese, compelled by their livelihoods, crossed the oceans; whether starting small businesses or serving as servants, they might earn a good amount of money, some even becoming tycoons, yet it's tough to attain political status commensurate with their financial capabilities. Whether immigrants of the Song dynasty or contemporary times, we seem to face the same question — how to transform from a guarded 'other' in a foreign land into a fully integrated member of the society; or maintain strong ties with the homeland, finding a sense of belonging from family back home.

In the era of growing global economy, immigrants' predicaments won't be much affected. However, once the global economy enters a full-scale contraction, the increasing fierce competition will gradually turn nationality, race, immigration, and ideologies into pronounced issues, an explicit challenge foreign arrivals will inevitably face in the future—varying by the host country, with the timing differing accordingly. 2023-12-23
