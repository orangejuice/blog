Via Twitter Tingyun: Quiet, beautiful, slow, and melancholic. A long poem dedicated to life. The dialogue is almost entirely poetic. Extensive narration. Greek winter, with snow, misty rain, the seaâ€”the interweaving of stories, reality, memory, and imagination. Everyone is a lost child, with nowhere to belong in this world. The cold, wet loneliness. Watching such a movie on a winter's night, one only wishes to hold their loved one tightly.
