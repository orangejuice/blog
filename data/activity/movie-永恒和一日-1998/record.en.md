Via tw Stop Cloud silent, beautiful, slow, melancholy. It is a long poem dedicated to life. The dialogues are almost all poetry. There's a lot of voice-over. Greek winter, snow, misty rain, the sea, the story, reality, memory, and imagination intertwine. Everyone is a lost child, without a place in the world. The loneliness is wet and cold. Watching such a movie on a winter night, all you want to do is to deeply hug the person you love.
