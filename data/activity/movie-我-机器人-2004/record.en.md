The story is too weak and dramatic, lacking conviction in its rises and falls. Undoubtedly, it's a formulaic film masquerading as a mystery, pursuing accessibility, sensory stimulation, and SFX-centric popcorn cinema. The only worth-watching aspect is that we're at a unique point in time, on the eve of the 2024 AI boom, communicating using text-based single-modal intelligence and waiting for the arrival of embodied intelligence. We are nervous, we anticipate.
