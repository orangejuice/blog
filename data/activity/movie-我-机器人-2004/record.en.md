The story is too fragile and overly dramatic, with ups and downs that are not convincing at all. It is undoubtedly a formulaic film dressed as a mystery, aiming for ultimate simplicity, sensory stimulation, and visual effects-driven popcorn movie entertainment. The only part worth watching is our unique position at the eve of the AI explosion in 2024, using uni-modal intelligence for text communication, awaiting the arrival of embodied intelligence. We are anxious, we anticipate.
