It's impressive how clever Yan can absorb and master the storytelling style of traditional, impoverished scholars imagining romances. After reading three chapters, I really didn't want to continue. The characters are thin and simple, their actions template-driven and mindless. With just this kind of story, he has produced so many pieces; changing the name and location results in a ten-thousand-word story, which is truly tasteless when read. It appears mastering padding is a basic skill for authors.
