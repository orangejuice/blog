So cute that it brought tears to my eyes. This is exactly what children should be watching, and it moved even an old person like me deeply. Kind and gentle, embracing diversity, accepting one's own differences as well as others', embracing growth, liking the process of growing up, and becoming stronger to maintain kindness and protect oneself and loved ones. Full of vitality, this unique expression of Japanese animated films is vividly captured in this film. Such a great spirit, full of liveliness, dispelling gloom, and making oneself and the lives around more beautiful.
