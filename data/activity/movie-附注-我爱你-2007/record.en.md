Via Twitter Mia watched 'P.S. I Love You' on the couch, crying like a fool. Wanted to record a vlog to capture the breakdown of tears after a late-night movie, but ended up looking like a boiling kettle... (Like the sound of those old-fashioned kettles when the water boils). Laughed and continued crying at the same time. Never watching a pure romance movie again, damn. It killed me.
