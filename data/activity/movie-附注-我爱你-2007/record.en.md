Via tw Mia watched 'P.S. I Love You' and cried like an idiot on the sofa. I wanted to record a vlog to capture my tearful meltdown after watching the movie late at night, and after filming I realized I was crying like a boiling kettle... (the sound of an old-fashioned kettle boiling) While finding it somewhat funny I continued to cry. I swear I'm never watching pure love movies again. It made me cry so much.
