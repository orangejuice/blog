  title: The French Mind
  subtitle: Peter Watson / 2022 / Simon & Schuster
  intro: >-
    The idea of the French way of life has been an endless source of
    fascination. When we think of France we think of food and fashion, of
    intellect and taste, sociability and fierce national pride. What is behind
    these conceptions of the French? How did France become the country it is
    today, and what makes it exceptional?

    Journalist and historian Peter Watson sets out to answer these questions in
    The French Mind, a dazzling cultural history of France that takes us from
    the 17th century to the present day through the nation’s most innovative and
    influential thinkers. He opens the doors to the Renaissance salons that
    acted as a breeding ground for poets, philosophers and scientists, and tells
    the extraordinary forgotten stories of the women who ran these vibrant and
    definitively French institutions, fostering a culture of intellectualism
    unmatched anywhere else in the word. On the way we witness the rise of café
    and restaurants, the changing relationship between the bourgeoisie and the
    French monarchy, and the bloody birth of a republic. From the French
    revolution to the country’s occupation by Nazi Germany, Watson argues that a
    series of devastating military defeats played a key role in shaping the
    resilient character of a nation, as well as its exceptionalism.

    The French Mind is a history of breathtaking scope, propelled forward by the
    characters Watson brings to vivid life: the artists, revolutionaries and
    writers who loved, inspired and competed with one another over four hundred
    years. It documents the shaping of a nation whose global influence, in art
    and culture, politics and philosophy, cannot be overestimated.
