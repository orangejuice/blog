Via Twitter, Lao Bai shares: This is a recent comforting read that I've discovered. The author is Wang Zengqi, an elderly man who truly knows how to live life. I enjoy brewing a pot of floral tea, nesting on my couch, and reading this book near the window while I soak in the afternoon sunshine. It feels as if time has slowed down. After finishing this book, I came to understand that caring for a bouquet of flowers or growing a pot of fruits can be so enriching. I've also started to take my time to appreciate life and the beauty that surrounds me. If you've been feeling anxious lately, I suggest reading a chapter or two before bed to calm your restless soul.
