Via tw Lao Bai
This is a healing little book I've recently read.

The author, Wang Zengqi, truly knows how to live life.

I like to brew a cup of floral tea, nestle on the sofa, and read this book by a sun-filled window in the afternoon, feeling the gentle warmth on my cheeks, living in the moment as if time itself slows down.

After finishing this book, I realized that planting a bunch of flowers and growing some fruits can also be so interesting. I've begun to slowly appreciate life and the beauty around me.

If you've been feeling anxious lately, try reading a chapter or two before bed each night. It can soothe the restless mind and calm the soul.
