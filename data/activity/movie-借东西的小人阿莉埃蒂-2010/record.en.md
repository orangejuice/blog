In the works of Hayao Miyazaki, young protagonists are always steadfast and brave, earnestly living their lives and shining like a meticulously designed kitchen as they face subtle challenges and witness growth. Experiencing this gentle and tender touch to the heart is truly a special experience. One can imagine being so old that all the teeth are nearly gone, yet cherishing a few animated movies like precious treasures. This tenderness and healing truly offer comfort and strength. ❤️ Immersed in such a soft movie, who would unnecessarily ponder the meaning of life?
