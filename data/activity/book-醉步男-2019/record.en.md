Via Twitter Hayami, 'The Drunken Man' truly has an LSD hallucinatory effect, after reading (again) you'll fall into an existential crisis: 'Why can man live in calmness?' Because the wave function can collapse, 'What tortures me?' It's the irresistible fate. 'Why can't man abandon hope?' Because the wave function can diverge.
