Via tw Hayami "The Staggering Man" really has LSD-like hallucinogenic effects, reading it again plunges one into an existential crisis: 

"Why can people live settled lives?"
Because the wave function can collapse
"What torments me?"
It is the irresistible fate.
"Why can't people give up hope?"
Because the wave function can diverge.
