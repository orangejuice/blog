Via Twitter Lillian #New Book Recommendation, 'The Restless Clock: Machinery, Life, Mobility, and the Formation of Modern Science.' This book was published by CITIC a few years ago, but for some unknown reason, it was published again. Can't understand the puzzling operation of the publisher, but it's said that this translation is better than the previous one. This cover design of the Chinese version is really indescribable (including an attached picture of the original cover for respect).
