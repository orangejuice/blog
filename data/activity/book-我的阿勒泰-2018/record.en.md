Via tw Stop Cloud, Li Juan's words can always bring me a little comfort at any time, just like when I am sad, there is a friend by my side, who occasionally gently shakes your arm. Walking in the cold night, thinking about a bowl of milk tea made from brick tea in her writing, a nan bread taken out of the earth stove, a tree root that temporarily serves as a dining table, they all feel warm.
