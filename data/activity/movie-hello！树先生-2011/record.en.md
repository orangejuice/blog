It's hard to evaluate. The setting is interesting, the story is flavorful, and the characters are great, but the texture is poorly handled, and the story presentation is not complete. It's like listening to a fascinating tale but the narrator has a communication barrier, always failing to make it clear. It's vague, disjointed, and lacks logic, so it can't fully present the story to the audience, which is a pity.
