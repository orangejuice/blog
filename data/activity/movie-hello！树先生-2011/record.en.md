It's hard to judge. The background is interesting, the story has its charm, the characters are well-drawn, but the quality of the presentation is lacking. The story does not unfold fully. It feels like listening to an intriguing story where the speaker has an expressive barrier and can't articulate clearly. The narrative is misty, disjointed and lacks logic which fails to fully expose the story to the audience. It's quite regrettable.
