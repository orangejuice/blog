      comment: "Via tw ting yun, in the preface to the reprint of Eileen Chang's
        'Legend': \"Even if individuals have time, the era is hasty, and it's
        already being destroyed, with greater devastation to come. One day our
        civilization, whether it is sublimated or flashy, will all become the
        past. If the word I use most often is 'desolate', it's because there is
        this bewildered threat in the conceptual context.\""

Via tw ting yun, in the preface to the reprint of Eileen Chang's 'Legend': "Even if individuals have time, the era is hasty, and it's already being destroyed, with greater devastation to come. One day our civilization, whether it is sublimated or flashy, will all become the past. If the word I use most often is 'desolate', it's because there is this bewildered threat in the conceptual context."

From 1943 to 1945 were Eileen Chang's most glorious days in this life and beyond, also the phase of life where flowers bloom in the intense flame and oil. Within just two years, she wrote 'Legend' and 'Fleeting Years', catapulting her to the pinnacle of the literary world. However, in 'A Small Reunion', she wrote: 'Memories, whether they are pleasant or not, all carry a sort of sadness, though faint, I fear that taste.'
