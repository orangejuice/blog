      comment: "In Eileen Chang's preface to the reprint of 'Legend': 'Even if an
        individual can wait, the era is hasty and is already under destruction,
        with more devastation yet to come. One day our civilization, whether it
        is refined or ostentatious, will belong to the past. If my most
        frequently used word is ‘desolation’, it is because there is this
        looming threat in the backdrop of my thoughts.'"

In Eileen Chang's preface to the reprint of 'Legend': 'Even if an individual can wait, the era is hasty and is already under destruction, with more devastation yet to come. One day our civilization, whether it is refined or ostentatious, will belong to the past. If my most frequently used word is ‘desolation’, it is because there is this looming threat in the backdrop of my thoughts.' / From 1943 to 1945 were the most brilliant days of Eileen Chang's life and a period marked by intense experiences as if in 'fire and flowers'. In just two years, she wrote 'Legend' and 'Fleeting Years', catapulting her to the pinnacle of the literary world. However, in 'The Little Reunion', she writes: Memories, whether pleasant or unpleasant, carry a certain sadness, and although faint, she fears that taste.
