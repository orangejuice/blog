A quite enlightening political drama, where the delicate tripartite relationship between Australia, China, and the US is well portrayed in a spy hub. What’s particularly interesting and engaging is Australia’s perception of China from a Western viewpoint. Despite a foreign and distinct sense of distance, the representation is very much equal and pragmatic, rather than perpetuating the usual negative imagery—like portraying it as a colossal, repulsive monster.
