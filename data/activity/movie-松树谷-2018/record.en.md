A quite enlightening political drama, delineating the intricate relations among Australia, China, and the US through the lens of a spy center. What I find interesting and attractive is how Australia, as a representative of Western viewpoints, perceives China. Although they showcase a kind of unfamiliarity and intense distance, their attitude is very reciprocal and pragmatic, deviating from the usual negative portrayal â€“ like a gigantic, repelling monster.
