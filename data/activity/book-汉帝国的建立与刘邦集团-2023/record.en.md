Via Twitter xone recommendation of Li Kaiyuan's "The Establishment of the Han Empire and the Liu Bang Group." Read many years ago, it was shocking at the time:
1) Japan's research into Chinese history is extremely meticulous.
2) The fading of the military merit class, although the Han dynasty could not be completely thorough, was still methodical and quite effective.
