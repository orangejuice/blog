Via tw Lao Bai, the book, although filled with sharp and satirical comments, exudes a sense of humaneness and encapsulates life. It effortlessly drags the reader into its world, enabling them to empathize with its characters. 

There's a classic line in the book: 'People outside the city want to rush in, people inside want to escape, be it marriage or career, such are the desires of life.' Such profound insight requires a rich accumulation of knowledge and life experience to articulate. 

In Qian's 'Fortress Besieged', the plot technique is secondary to the witty dialogue, life experiences, and the profound humor. 

Through the replay of life experiences of the protagonists, one could get a glimpse of the bitterness, sorrow, pain, and spice of life, as if they've lived an additional life, causing one to sigh incessantly.
