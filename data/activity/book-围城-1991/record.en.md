Via Twitter user Lao Bai: Although the book is filled with piercing satire at every turn, it exudes a sense of humanity, encapsulating life so vividly that one feels as though they are living within it, experiencing it firsthand. There is a classic line in the book: 'Those outside the city want to rush in, and those inside want to escape, be it marriage or a career, such are the general desires in life.' Such a line could not have been written without a rich accumulation of knowledge and life experiences. Mr. Qianâ€™s 'Fortress Besieged,' while the plot technique is secondary, it is the witty dialogue, life lessons, and profound humor that take center stage. Through the life retrospectives of several principal characters, one can prematurely taste the bitterness, sourness, and spiciness of life, as if walking through life oneself, leaving one utterly moved.
