A standard documentary, devoid of any interesting elements. The production is rigid, the shots lackluster, and the animations are too abstract and weakly connected to the content. Despite the numerous grandiose animations that bring ancient architecture to life, it's hard to tell how much of it is authentic or simply for show. The viewing experience is rushed, with scenes whizzing by as if we aren't allowed a closer look. There is no discernable vision or enthusiasm, making the viewing experience quite dull. If the people behind the production lacked interest, how can the audience be expected to find it interesting? After sticking it out to the end, it felt more like a high school lecture than a documentary. On Douban, domestic documentaries like this typically receive an extra 1-2 points out of sympathy.
