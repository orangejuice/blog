A standard documentary work with no entertaining value. It comes across as constrained in its creativity, static in its cinematography, and the animations are mystical yet poorly related to the content. It includes some grand animations of ancient architectural reconstructions which merit a closer look based on their realism and extent of display. However, viewers aren't given enough time to appreciate these, as the camera quickly moves on. The lack of visible creative goals and passion makes it a dull affair. The lack of engagement from the creators reflects in the viewing experience, making it uninspiring. Watching it felt like sitting through a class in high school. The ratings on Douban for domestic documentaries are generally inflated by 1 to 2 points due to leniency.
