      comment: Steady pace, rich in details, full of life and soul, unique rootedness
        in the absurdity of Chinese local society, a rare deep reflection on the
        historical phenomena of the recent past, a sense of humanitarian concern
        and compassion, and a rich portrayal of characters making it utterly
        comfortable to watch. Although the performances are not top-notch, they
        are earnest and vigorous, which enhances the naive, culturally inept,
        and clumsy portrayal of the nation. Emotional expressions often rely not
        on words or actions, but on complex gazes. The female actors contribute
        significantly with their expressive eyes. Jiang Wen is utterly
        remarkable; in the movie, he exemplifies a cultured, literate, dancing,
        musically inclined, devil-may-care lothario who also pretends to be
        profound to flirt. His vibe is distinctly modern and radically different
        from the rustic charm of the rest, very akin to a modern-day prince
        raised under the imperial gates. Living on, just to survive like beasts,
        made people's hearts broken. It's an indisputably intriguing world where
        the mad appear sane and the sane turn mad. The ending leaves one longing
        for more. Such masterpieces make one hope for more within one's
        lifetime. After watching, one can't help but crave a spicy bowl of rice
        bean curd.

Steady pace, rich in details, full of life and soul, unique rootedness in the absurdity of Chinese local society, a rare deep reflection on the historical phenomena of the recent past, a sense of humanitarian concern and compassion, and a rich portrayal of characters making it utterly comfortable to watch. Although the performances are not top-notch, they are earnest and vigorous, which enhances the naive, culturally inept, and clumsy portrayal of the nation.

Jiang Wen is incredibly impressive; in the movie, he is the cultured, literate, dancing, musically inclined, devil-may-care lothario, who also pretends to be profound to flirt. His modern air distinctly sets him apart from the earthy tones of the others, akin to a modern-day prince raised by the imperial roots. Living on, just to survive like beasts, leaves people's hearts shattered to pieces. It's an interesting world where the sane seem insane and the insane appear sane. The ending leaves one wanting more. Such masterpieces make one hope for more in a lifetime. After watching, one can't help but crave a spicy bowl of rice bean curd.
