The pacing is steady, details are rich, vivacious and spirited, featuring a uniquely Chinese sense of absurdity deeply rooted within the society. It possesses a rare deep contemplation and concern for modern historical phenomena, filled with humanitarian care and compassion. The ensemble of characters is richly painted, making it extremely comfortable to watch. Although the performances aren't top-tier, the earnest effort complements an artless and clumsy portrayal of a culture-deficient and misunderstood nation. Much of the emotional delivery relies not on anything else but complex gazes. The female leads contribute significantly to the performances with their expressive eyes. Jiang Wen is truly remarkable, embodying a cultured individual in the film, literate, dancer, musician, frivolous, and adept at playing deep to charm women. His style, distinct from the earthy and rural others, closely resembles a modern prince raised near the imperial city. The persistent struggle to survive, mundane yet emotionally shattering, punctuates the interesting nature of life wherein the sane seem mad and the mad seem sane. The ending leaves one longing for more. Such a masterpiece, I deeply hope for more of these in my lifetime, a perfect 10 stars. Watching it makes me crave a spicy bowl of rice and bean curd.
