I really didn't expect this movie to be so excellent. It captures a unique, narrow narrative space in China, truly representing a fascinating artistic flash of the 80s! The script is ingenious, the camera language is delicate, and the character of Sparrow is breathtaking. Sparrow is down-to-earth, studious, hardworking, kind and energetic, along with a bit of luck and just the right stubbornness and self-personality, yet she seems lost at the crossing of this social upheaval. This fusion and friction spark intense sparks. The extreme loneliness of the soul: not being understood by everyone around; the ruthless mockery of fate: seeing the beauty of freedom and liberation, but trapped by the vines beyond one's control. If two people want to be together for a long time, if one party grows and changes, then the other party must go in the same direction; if one party prefers to stay in place, the other party also needs to stay in place; if you really want to build a perfect love, it's not simpler than rocket science. In this world of vicissitudes, there is always one person who has to sacrifice something. The raw and rough charm of the Chinese style forms a glaring visual contrast with the restrained and delicate formalism of the Japanese style.
