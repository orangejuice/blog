Via Twitter, from Left Hand Ink about the right of the first night, 'The Sacrificed 'Local'' describes it as follows:

In many regions, there are legends from the Yuan dynasty about the Mongols imposing the right of the first night on the Han people. Although there is considerable controversy over whether there are historical facts to support this, the Yuan dynasty nobility highly regarded the right of the first night regardless. At the beginning of the Yuan dynasty, 'northerners were very fond of people skilled from the south, called 'skilled children', and they were very expensive. Women, in particular, were even more valuable, with each one exchanged for two to three hundred taels of silver, especially cherishing young boys and girls. There were people markets everywhere, with different classes and prices, all southerners.'

The most common curse words in China (similar to 'Fuck your mother') were widely popular in the Yuan dynasty and might be related to the right of the first night. When parties argue, if one exposes having owned the other's mother's first night, it also implies that the other might be their offspring, showcasing their superior genetic and power status.
Therefore, whether it is people maintaining dignity in reality or gods with supernatural abilities, the right of the first night holds an important place in their lives.
