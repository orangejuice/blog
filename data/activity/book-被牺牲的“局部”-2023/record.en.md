        Via tw 左手墨迹 Regarding the right of the first night, 'The Sacrificed
        Local' says this:


        In many regions, there is a legend from the Yuan dynasty about the
        Mongols enforcing the right of the first night on the Han people.
        Although there is still considerable controversy over whether this is
        historically factual, the Yuan nobility highly valued the right of the
        first night. At the beginning of the Yuan dynasty, 'the northerners were
        very fond of the craftsmen from the south, calling them 'skillful
        children', and they were very expensive. As for women, they were even
        more valuable, each one being traded for two to three hundred taels of
        silver, especially fond of young boys and girls, with people markets
        everywhere, and prices varying by several grades, all were southern men
        and women.'


        The most common swear word in China (similar to 'F*** your mother')
        became widely popular during the Yuan dynasty, possibly related to the
        right of the first night. When two parties argued, if one party revealed
        having the right of the first night with the other's mother, it also
        implied that the opponent might be their own offspring, thus showing
        their superior status in terms of bloodline and power. Therefore,
        whether it is people upholding dignity in reality or gods with
        supernatural powers, the right of the first night holds an important
        place in their lives.

via tw @小径残雪 Not only the ignorant masses are like this, but also the literati occasionally have such beliefs. During our investigation, we found that as late as the 1920s and 1930s, there still existed the barbaric custom of 'chopping children' in northern Huai! In a certain place in Donghai County, some households would experience infants and toddlers being repeatedly harmed over several days. The villagers did not blame the medical conditions, nor did they blame their own inadequate care of the children, but suspected a 'debt-collecting ghost'. If a child fell ill again, the father would take him to a crossroads and kill him with a knife. The number of bloodstains on his belt was used to predict the number of children he would have in the future. Until much later, many places in northern Huai regarded newborns with deformities as 'monsters', and family members would kill them using various methods associated with witchcraft. Someone rightly wrote: 'Children in Chinese families are very unfortunate.'
