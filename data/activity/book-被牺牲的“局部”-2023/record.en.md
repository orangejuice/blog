Via tw Left Hand Ink, here's what 'The Sacrificed Partial' says about the right to the first night:

In many regions, there's a legend about the Mongols enforcing the right to the first night on the Han people during the Yuan Dynasty. Although there's considerable controversy over whether this has historical factual basis. Regardless, the Yuan Dynasty aristocracy valued the right to the first night greatly. In the early Yuan period, 'Northern people were fond of skillful people from the South, who were called 'Qiaoer', and their value was very high. As for women, they were even more precious, each priced at two to three hundred taels of silver, especially loved were young boys and girls, there were markets for people everywhere, all classes were represented, all were Southern men and women.'

The most common vulgar language in China (similar to 'F*ck your mother') was widely used in the Yuan Dynasty, which could be related to the right of the first night. When arguments occur, if one side reveals that they had the first night with the other's mother, it implies that the other party could be their own offspring, fully revealing their genetic and power superiority.

Therefore, whether it's a person maintaining dignity in reality or a god with supernatural powers, the right to the first night holds an important place in their lives.
