Watching it with friends, the intensely male perspective made me feel a bit awkward sitting there, but that's okay. There should be equal perspectives, male perspectives, and female perspectives. During the viewing, some scenes occasionally reminded me of movies I had seen before, but I completely forgot the name and many of the plot details. This probably means that besides the male perspective, the movie is still somewhat bland and not very appealing to me.
