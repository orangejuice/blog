I watched this with a friend and the pronounced masculine perspective made me feel somewhat awkward sitting there, but that's okay, there should be a balance of views - there are male perspectives and female ones. Throughout the movie, there were moments from various scenes that reminded me of something I had seen before, yet I have completely forgotten the title and many of the plot points. This probably goes to show that, besides the male perspective, this movie is rather lackluster and fails to win me over.
