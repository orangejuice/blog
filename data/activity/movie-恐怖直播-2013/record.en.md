Very impressive. The use of live broadcasting to unfold the storyline is novel, and the topic focuses on societal issues, not avoiding the pessimistic reality of existing problems, without resorting to foolish optimism as a cover-up. The powerlessness and sorrow of a small character against the system are expressed well. The story itself doesn't have many noteworthy places, and I feel it's somewhat muddled as if the storylines and characters are being forcefully stuffed into a shell. But the care and introspection that this shell brings is the true gem, with a hope that it will soon take root across that vast land.
