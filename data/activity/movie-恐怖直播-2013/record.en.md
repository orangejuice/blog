Exceptional, employing live streaming as a means to unfold the plot is innovative and topical, focusing on societal issues without shying away from the grim realities of the existing problems, and not just glossing over them with naive optimism. The powerlessness and sadness of the small people against the system are on display. The story itself isnâ€™t particularly remarkable, feeling a bit forced into a shell with storylines and characters crammed in. However, the care and reflection that this shell embodies are indeed the shining treasures, hoping to take root sooner on that vast land.
