The war scenes are very grand and spectacular, I'm surprised this is a movie released in 2001. The emotional setup at the beginning was very boring in comparison, focusing on the narrative style of individual heroes which is very characteristic of Western culture. There aren't any issues with the entire movie, very touching.
