The war scenes are incredibly grand and spectacular; it's surprising that this movie premiered in 2001. The emotional setup at the beginning was quite boring in comparison, focusing on a narrative style centered on the heroic individual, which is very characteristic of Western culture. Overall, the film is flawless and very moving.
