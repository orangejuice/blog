Via tw shao ping's review of 'Hit Refresh' by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, found it to be fascinating. This book was published back in 2018, and my copy is from the 29th print run. I've seen a few heavy recommendations for it recently, and I have just finished reading it. My first impression is that Nadella demonstrates excellent ability, diligent effort, and empathetic leadership. Qian Yingyi highly praised the book in the preface for its plain narrative, profound philosophy, and focus on both reality and the future. The content of the book revolves around how Nadella reshaped Microsoft, his differences with Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, how he constructed a cooperative ecosystem, and his plans for the future. Nadella also shows great insights in marketing. Surprisingly, he chose Kenya for the launch of Windows 10, bypassing Paris, London, or Tokyo. His three leadership principles are simple and concise. Nadella discusses the proverbial 'glass ceiling' encountered by Indians in Silicon Valley, but he himself shattered this barrier with unwavering faith. Nadella's family life isn't perfect; his eldest son has severe cerebral palsy and his daughter has dyslexia.
