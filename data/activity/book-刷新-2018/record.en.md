Via Twitter user Shao Ping, after finishing Satya Nadella's 'Refresh', it's fascinating. The book was published in 2018, and my copy is already the 29th printing. Recently, I've seen several recommendations, and today I finally finished reading it. My first impression is that Nadella is an exceptionally capable, hardworking, and empathetic leader. In the foreword, Qian Yingyi highly praises it for being down-to-earth, philosophical, focused on the present but also mindful of the future. The content revolves around how Nadella reshaped Microsoft, his differences from Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, how he built a collaborative ecosystem, and his future planning. Nadella also shows deep marketing insights; he chose Kenya for the Windows 10 launch event, instead of Paris, London, or Tokyo. His three principles of leadership are concise and to the point. Nadella talks about the glass ceiling for Indians in Silicon Valley, but he breaks through it with firm belief. Nadella's family life is not perfect; his eldest son has severe cerebral palsy and his daughter has dyslexia.
