I don't know why, but the whimsical world of magic fails to draw me in. Perhaps it's because this contrived world lacks a logical foundation, its dazzling facade unable to mask the hollow shell within, leaving all the tumultuous changes and dramatic emergences to appear and disappear into thin air. The heavy, colorful filters, the intentionally crafted youth dance to highlight conflicts, the deadly competitions with nonsensical rules and no protection, and the villain who works tirelessly behind the scenes for decades, steadfast in his schemes yet never killing Harry because without Harry the author wouldn't know how to continue the story. Yes, and the dazzlingly invincible protagonistâ€™s aura that tires me. If a child were to truly imagine a world in this manner, we might guess that they are extremely self-centered, unable to understand the equality between themselves and others, adept at being deceitful and pretentious with a penchant for double standards, and dismissive of scientific progress, the quest for essence, the greater good, and truly loving others. This work's popularity perhaps illustrates that our world is filled with such people.
