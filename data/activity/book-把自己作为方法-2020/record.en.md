via tw whispered readings, 'Taking Oneself as a Method' starts from Professor Xiang Biao's personal experiences and explores a series of issues beyond the self, involving reflections on China's social changes over half a century, intellectual community, globalization and populism, anthropological methodology, and other topics. It's a good book though it has many limitations. It can inspire divergent thinking and be used for one's purposes.
