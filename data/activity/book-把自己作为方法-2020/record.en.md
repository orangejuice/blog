Via Twitter, from the quietly read book "Take Oneself as a Method", starting from Professor Xiang Biao's personal experiences, it explores a series of questions about transcending oneself, including reflections on the changes in Chinese society over the past half-century, the knowledge community, globalization and populism, and anthropological methodologies. 

It is a good book, yet with many limitations, which can expand one's thinking for personal use.
