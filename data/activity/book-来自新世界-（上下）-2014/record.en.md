Via Twitter, Crescent Moon: 'From the New World' is one of the top three animations in my view. It is an original work scoring 120 - a classic of our time. Its adaptation into an animation gets a 90. As a dystopian masterpiece, it obviously excels among animations in terms of ideological depth. However, it also highlights by contrast that most well-known animations are merely pandering to children. The strongest aspect of 'Shinsekai Yori' is its setting - rigorously scientific - firstly, because the setting is incredibly self-consistent which allows someone with a compulsion for logic like me to comfortably engage with it... Secondly, its political allegories are strikingly close to societal realities.
