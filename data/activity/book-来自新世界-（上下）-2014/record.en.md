User 'San Ri Yue' comments 'From the New World' is one of the top three animations in my view. The original work is a contemporary masterpiece with a score of 120, and the animation scores 90. As an archetype of dystopian thought, 'From the New World' is an outstanding animation. But it also serves as a contrast because most of the masterpieces in animation are still child's play. The strongest aspect of 'From the New World' is its settings, which are precise and scientific. First, the settings are extremely self-consistent, so I, someone with obsessive-compulsive logic, can watch it calmly. Second, the political metaphors in the settings are too close to societal realities.
