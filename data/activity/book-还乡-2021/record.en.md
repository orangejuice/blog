via Twitter Tingyun I really enjoy Hardy's serene depiction of the Edun Moor. Mr. Zhang Gurus's translation is quaint yet blends the vernacular of the Shandong plains. Edun Moor is Hardy's hometown, and he is familiar with every grass and tree there. Under Hardy's pen, the bleak moor is alive; the howling north wind sings like an old man, and the arriving birds are philosophers with golden sayings. The soft ferns always accompany the tough evergreen thorns, and the people of the moor have become one with it, shaping their characters and fates. The proud and beautiful Tess has always wanted to escape the moor to the bustling big cities, much like the small-town youths yearning for metropolises years ago, while Clinn, a youth who returns from Paris, desires to return to the tranquil life of the moor. These two with differing dreams, nevertheless fall in love and marry recklessly. From the start, their marriage is destined to be a tragedy, their opposite life ideals perhaps representing dreams of different life stages. Inopportune encounters, yet destined to fall in love.
