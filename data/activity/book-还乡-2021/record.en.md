via tw Tingyun, I really like Hardy's quiet depiction of the Egdon Heath. Mr. Zhang Gu Ruo's translation is quaint and also embodies the simplicity of Shandong plains. Egdon Heath is Hardy's hometown and he is familiar with every plant and tree here. In Hardyâ€™s pen, Egdon Heath has life: the howling north wind is like an old man singing, the birds that fly in are philosophers who spit out fine words, the soft ferns are always accompanied by rigid evergreens, the people on the heath have already become one with the heath, it shapes their character and destiny. The proud and beautiful Eustacia has always wanted to escape from the heath and go to the bustling city, just like the young men in the small town yearned for the first-tier cities years ago. The young Clement who returned from Paris wanted to return to the quiet life of the heath. These two people who have different dreams still fell in love and got married against all odds. Right from the start, it was bound to be a tragedy. Their diametrically opposed life ideals may be the dreams of individuals at different stages of life. They met at an inopportune time, yet were destined to fall in love.
