via tw johanna Just finished reading a book tonight, and happened to see it when I was looking for the next one. Not many people should know about this book, so I recommend it. I was fortunate to read it more than a decade ago. If you are interested in the social status of China during a certain historical period like I do, I suggest you read this book, it's very interesting.
