via Twitter johanna: Just finished reading a book tonight, and coincidentally saw this one while searching for the next one. Not many people may know about this book, so I thought I’d recommend it. I was fortunate enough to read it over a decade ago, and if you are intrigued by the social conditions, customs, and sentiments of a certain historical period in China like I am, I suggest you read this book. It’s very interesting.
