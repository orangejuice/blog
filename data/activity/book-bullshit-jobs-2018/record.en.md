via tw viking, I was previously very fond of the book 'Bullshit Jobs: A Theory'. It's a perennial frontrunner on Amazon and has been translated into over a dozen languages, having fundamentally changed my life in many ways. It was one of the motivators for me shifting to freelance work.
The entire book came like a wakeup call to me. I also noticed many people around me stuck in bullshit jobs: paid employment that is entirely pointless, unnecessary, or even harmful, and even the employees themselves can't justify the existence of their work. I am left wondering what they are busy with every day.
There's a category of jobs that apparently have nothing to do in the eyes of outsiders, yet are familiar to everyone: HR consultants, communication coordinators, PR researchers, financial strategists, business lawyers, or those who spend their time filling out committeesâ€“ committees specifically designed to review whether there are too many committee members... At that point, I wondered whether these jobs were indeed useless and whether the people doing these jobs were well aware of it.
