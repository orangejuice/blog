I used to really like the book 'Bullshit Jobs: A Theory'. It has been a perennial bestseller on Amazon and has been translated into more than a dozen languages. It changed my life to some extent and was one of the motivations for me to start freelancing.

The entire book was a revelation for me, and I feel that many people around me are also stuck in 'bullshit jobs': a type of paid employment that is completely meaningless, unnecessary, and even harmful, where even the employees themselves cannot justify the existence of their work. I don't even know what I am busy with every day. 

“There are some jobs that, in the eyes of outsiders, seem idle and familiar to everyone: human resources consultants, communication coordinators, public relations researchers, financial strategists, business lawyers, or those spending time filling committee seats for review committees that address redundancy... That was when I wondered whether these jobs are truly useless and whether the people doing them are fully aware of it.”
