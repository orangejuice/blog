  title: Bullshit Jobs
  subtitle: David Graeber / 2018 / Simon & Schuster
  intro: >-
    From bestselling writer David Graeber, a powerful argument against the rise
    of meaningless, unfulfilling jobs, and their consequences.

    Does your job make a meaningful contribution to the world? In the spring of
    2013, David Graeber asked this question in a playful, provocative essay
    titled “On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs.” It went viral. After a million
    online views in seventeen different languages, people all over the world are
    still debating the answer.

    There are millions of people—HR consultants, communication coordinators,
    telemarketing researchers, corporate lawyers—whose jobs are useless, and,
    tragically, they know it. These people are caught in bullshit jobs.

    Graeber explores one of society’s most vexing and deeply felt concerns,
    indicting among other villains a particular strain of finance capitalism
    that betrays ideals shared by thinkers ranging from Keynes to Lincoln.
    Bullshit Jobs gives individuals, corporations, and societies permission to
    undergo a shift in values, placing creative and caring work at the center of
    our culture. This book is for everyone who wants to turn their vocation back
    into an avocation.

via tw viking 我之前非常喜欢一本书 《Bullshit Jobs: A Theory》狗屁工作，亚马逊常年排行榜前列，翻译成了十几种语言，在一定程度上改变了我的人生，也是我做自由职业的动机之一。

整个书对我来说是振聋发聩的，我也感觉到身边的很多人也陷入到狗屁工作的境地里：一种有偿就业，完全没有意义的、不必要的、甚至有害的工作，连员工自己都不能为其工作的存在而正言。不知道自己每天都在忙些什么。
“有一类工作，在圈外人眼里闲闲没事，而且每个人都不陌生：人力资源顾问、沟通协调人、公关研究员、财务策略师、商务律师，或是把时间花在给委员会充人头、而这个委员会是要检讨委员会人浮于事的那种人……那时我想，会不会这些工作真的毫无用处，而且做这些事的人都心知肚明。”
