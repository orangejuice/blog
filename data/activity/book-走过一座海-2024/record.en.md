This is a book sent by the editor Via tw Morgan. At first, I didn't hold out hope, but the more I read, the more I want to slap my thigh! Grassroots writers are just so vigorous and strong. My colleague, Auntie Wang, is also a vigorous person - she's someone who, if not given an opportunity, will create one herself.
