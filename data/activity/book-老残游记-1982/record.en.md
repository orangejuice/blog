To understand #Chinese politics, one should read #Laocan Youji. Corruption is not the root cause of dynastic changes, and the self-righteous #IdealistParty who tends to cause more harm than good has impacted the late Qing much more than foreign powers, civilian uprisings, and corrupt officials. #Laocan Youji keenly identifies an overlooked aspect of Chinese politics: Qing bureaucrats ruining the country. Those officials who preach about sentiments and ideals and deem themselves righteous are more inclined to extreme conservatism similar to feudal practices, and are more cruel towards Chinese society.
