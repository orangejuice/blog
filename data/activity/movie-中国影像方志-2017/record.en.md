I came across this documentary while searching for local gazetteers. It appeared to be a grand project, aiming to document every county and district in the country, even featuring a dedicated website. I immediately looked up an episode about my hometown. However, the more I watched, the more disappointed I became. The content was empty and ideological, filled with exaggerated patriotism and overwhelmingly focused on red history and figures. The filming was staged, superficial, and relied entirely on slow, pointless rhetoric to pad out the runtime. It lacks any semblance of professionalism or reverence for profound history, hardly qualifying as a gazetteer documentary. Perhaps it is my problem, in an era so noisy and superficial, what else can one expect? A masterpiece filled with historical knowledge, stable and down-to-earth? Who would bother to watch a detailed study of the history of a small, broken-down county town, digging out unknown local tales when such programs, even if produced, attract no interest?
