I stumbled upon this documentary while looking up local gazetteers. It seems massive, with the ambition to create documentary for each county across the country, including a dedicated website where I quickly found an episode about my hometown. But the more I watched, the more disappointed I became. The content is hollow, filled with ideology and fervent rhetoric, dominated by narratives of red figurines, red history, and everything in red. The camera work is heavily staged, overly formal, and relies entirely on sluggish bombast to sustain an entire episode. It lacks any respect for profound history and professional spirit, falling short of being a local gazetteer documentary. But maybe this is my problem. In such a noisy and impulsive era, what deep historical knowledge or steady excellent work can be expected? Who has the time to watch local gazetteers of small broken country towns, or dig into an unknown piece of local history through interviews? Even if such programs were made, no one would be interested.
