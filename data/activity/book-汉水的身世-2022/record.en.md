From the perspective of relying on existing resources, the book discusses the Three Gorges Project's impact on tributaries like the Han River. The construction has harshly interrupted the migratory fish paths leading to their extinction. The significant reduction in fish catch has forced fishers to fish for immature species released by fisheries. Amid this grim ecological background, a ten-year fishing ban started in 2020 on the Yangtze River and its tributaries. In this grand scheme, generations of fishermen on the Yangtze have become those footing the bill for the cacophony in the resplendent symphony of this huge project.
