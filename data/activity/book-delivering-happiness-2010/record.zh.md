    The visionary CEO of Zappos explains how an emphasis on corporate culture
    can lead to unprecedented success.

    Pay new employees $2000 to quit. Make customer service the entire company,
    not just a department. Focus on company culture as the #1 priority. Apply
    research from the science of happiness to running a business. Help employees
    grow both personally and professionally. Seek to change the world. Oh, and
    make money too.

    Sound crazy? It's all standard operating procedure at Zappos.com, the online
    retailer that's doing over $1 billion in gross merchandise sales every year.

    In 1999, Tony Hsieh (pronounced Shay) sold LinkExchange, the company he
    co-founded, to Microsoft for $265 million. He then joined Zappos as an
    adviser and investor, and eventually became CEO.

    In 2009, Zappos was listed as one of Fortune magazine's top 25 companies to
    work for, and was acquired by Amazon later that year in a deal valued at
    over $1.2 billion on the day of closing.

    In his first book, Tony shares the different business lessons he learned in
    life, from a lemonade stand and pizza business through LinkExchange, Zappos,
    and more. Ultimately, he shows how using happiness as a framework can
    produce profits, passion, and purpose both in business and in life.
