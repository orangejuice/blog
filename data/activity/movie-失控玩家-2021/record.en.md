The narrative framework of the story is quite playful, and the male lead's performance is adorable with several touching scenes. Despite being based on the philosophical dilemma of artificial intelligence, it does not aim to be serious, complex or profound. The film is full of love arcs that drive it forward. The performance is kept simple, clearly indicating who is good or evil. The ending wraps it up neatly with a happy reunion, making it a carefree movie that doesn't require much thinking. (The high quality, high intelligence, kindness and healing aspects of the AI far exceed human comparison)
