The narrative structure offers quite a bit to play with, and the male lead's performance is endearing, with some touching moments. Although it revolves around the philosophical dilemmas of artificial intelligence, it avoids becoming too serious or complex. The film is filled with a love story that drives the plot forward, with performances that straightforwardly depict good or bad sides, and ends lightly with a family reunion. It's a breezy movie that doesn't require much thought, just viewingâ€”and the AI's high quality, high intelligence, and benevolent nature are healing, making humans seem lesser in comparison.
