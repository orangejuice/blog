      comment: I am nothing, the wind, the sky, surviving by capitulating others. I
        possess a silent, gloomy heart, perplexed by human behaviour without
        understanding. Monetarily deprived, my will is despaired. I dread
        disputes and strife between people, yet don't have the energy to resist.
        I can't understand my preferences and dislikes, tired of mundane vanity
        and its twisting turns. I can't love others. I wish for the constant
        happiness of innocent girls. This sentiment exists within me - Hiroaki
        Tateiwa.

I am nothing, I am the wind, the sky, dependent on pleasing others to survive. I bear a silent and gloomy heart, with immense confusion and incomprehension towards the behaviors of mankind. I am dispirited by a lack of money, fearing conflict and struggle among people yet not having the energy to fight. I can't comprehend my likes and dislikes, tired of the mundane vanity, indirect and deceitful. I lack the ability to love others, wishing for the ever-lasting happiness of innocent and kind girls - the sentiment deeply ingrained in Hiroaki Tateiwa.
