      comment: I am nothing, the wind, the sky, living solely to please others,
        harboring a silent and melancholic heart, filled with immense confusion
        about human behavior, impoverished and dispirited, frightened by
        conflicts and struggles between people without the strength to resist,
        baffled by my own likes and dislikes, tired of banal vanities and
        indirectness, incapable of loving others, wishing for the eternal
        happiness of pure and kind-hearted girls like Yoko.
