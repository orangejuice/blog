The depth of the narrative leaves one speechless and is very in line with Jiang Wen's style. Gong Li's performance was not outstanding. When expected to express emotion, she suppressed it all with her polished Mandarin. The hazy/surrealistic style of expression should also lose points as it gives a peculiar feeling of pretentiousness and inability to speak effectively. Apart from this, the performances of the wine brewers are fine, and there seems to have been a fair investment in terms of set and props. This has received a high rating.
