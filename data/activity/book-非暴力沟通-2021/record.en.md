        Via Twitter, Xue Song mentioned the "annoying way of talking,"
        recommending everyone to learn from the book "Nonviolent Communication."


        Yes, that's right, this book is not just to be "read," but a textbook to
        be "practiced" with.


        It also doesn't teach you how to be smooth or even unscrupulous but
        teaches you how to communicate correctly and avoid misunderstandings.


        It's important to know that text content only accounts for 7% of the
        total information in communication, voice/tone accounts for 38%, and
        body language 55%.


        This means that in pure text communication (like on Twitter), 93% of the
        information is lost.


        At this point, expressing the emotional content of non-textual
        information becomes crucial.

I've always felt bad about how I spoke since I was young. It wasn't until I found the American-written "Nonviolent Communication" that I felt like I found a treasure, and after practicing it for half a year, I found it incredibly useful.
