      comment: Via tw, Xue Zou mentioned 'irritating ways of talking', and recommended
        that everyone learn from the book 'Nonviolent Communication'. That's
        right, this book is not for “reading”, but for “practice”. The book is
        not about teaching people how to become slick or even thick-skinned, but
        about teaching you how to communicate correctly and avoid
        misunderstandings. Remember, verbal content only accounts for 7% of
        total information in communication, voice / tone accounts for 38%, and
        body language accounts for 55%. In other words, pure text communication
        without visual and auditory aids (like on Twitter) will lose 93% of
        information. At this time, expressing emotional information of
        non-verbal content in words becomes extremely important.

I've always felt I spoke badly since I was young. However, after encountering the American-book 'Nonviolent Communication', it felt like a great treasure. After half a year of practical application, it feels so useful.
