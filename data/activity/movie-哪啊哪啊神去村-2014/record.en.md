Although the male lead's aura makes it a bit clich√©d, the romance still possesses the power to strike directly at the heart. The male lead is promising, handling both facial and physical acting prolific apparently guiding other actors in their comedic antics right beside him. The push and pull scenes are brilliantly executed. This surreal and mystical festival does not disappoint, keeping half a day's suspense alive. Far from the internet, this idyllic haven full of love includes handsome men and beautiful women, a steadfast man devoted to you, a pure and brave countryside beauty, reverence for nature, nature loving you back, bathed in tradition, with the mountain god bringing good fortune to people, a song of fantasy for the modern day.
