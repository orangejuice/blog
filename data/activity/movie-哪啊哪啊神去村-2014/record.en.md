Although the protagonist's glow makes it a bit cliché, the romance still has the power to touch the heart. The protagonist shows potential, regardless of whether it's his facial or body acting, the other actors' hilarious actions often make people feel like it's the protagonist directing on the side. Those shots where one is attacking and one is yielding are great. This fantastical scene of the festival lifts the half-day long suspense. Away from the network, there is a simple yet loving paradise with handsome men and beautiful women. A love story of decisive men who are singularly focused on you, innocent and lovely countryside girls, respects for nature, love naturally given, bathed in tradition where the mountain god helps humans, a song of contemporary people's fantasies.
