A novel storyline concept, but it's essentially old wine in a new bottle, combined with an especially conservative and clich√©d plot development and character design. The progression and rationality of the storyline are implausible. The film turns the fictional concept of reincarnation into a fantasy of devoting a lifetime of love to a woman in a painting, completely detached from reality. Bystanders show no reaction to bizarre events. The sense of disconnection is strong.
