The plot brings a fresh set of clues, but reuses old formulas, pairing them with a particularly conservative, clich√©d, and unoriginal storyline and character setting. The narrative's progression and its validity are hard to justify. The tale turns the hypothetical notion of reincarnation into a fantasy about a woman in a painting who devotes her life to loving him with a fervor divorced from the worldly. Extraordinary events are met with no reaction from passers-by, leading to a strong sense of disconnect.
