      comment: "Via Douban Junjun Wang: 'Humans have such a short lifespan, why not
        try to understand them while they are alive? Elves live so long, is it
        worth spending eternity studying one thing? Can't pull out the sword,
        just be a pretend hero. Missed love, might as well take the road again.
        Blossoming flowers, a vain statue, see the meteor shower that comes
        every fifty years twice. A thousand years of calm, a century of
        solitude, a singular simple joyous journey is as brilliant as a song.'"

It's a relaxing adventure story with some common settings in the gaming world. Endowed with boundless magical powers and eternal life, fearless of all unknown challenges ahead, unrestrained and casual, and having a petite, lovely, and harmlessly cute appearance, it's like the portrayal of a perfect character in modern people's minds.
