        By Wang Junjun on douban - Human life is so short, why not take the time
        to understand him while he is alive?

        The lifespan of elves is so long, is it worth it to dedicate eternity to
        study something thoroughly?

        If you can't pull out the magic sword, just be a fake hero.

        If you missed love, might as well retrace the path.

        Flourishing flowers and vain statues, a meteor shower every fifty years
        warrants watching it twice.

        The millennium's silence, a century's solitude, one ordinary but joyful
        journey is enough to shine brilliantly like a song.

A light-hearted adventure story that also incorporates common settings found in gaming worlds. With infinite magical power and unending lifespan, fearless of any unknowns and future challenges, living a carefree life without constraints, and possessing a tiny harmless body and face, it seems to exemplify the modern ideal of a perfect persona.
