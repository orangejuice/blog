Modern society and sibling rivalry for power merge in this bizarre way, marking it as a significant historical event. The primal force at the depth of life has always been occurring, and we've been lucky to avoid it, but witnessing it unfold today, one can feel the overwhelming, ruthless force that brings deep despair. This film is excellently produced, rich in details, and compelling in narrative, immersing the audience in the twisted and bizarre nature of the case itself.
