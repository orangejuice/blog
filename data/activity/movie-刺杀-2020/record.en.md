The combination of modern society and sibling rivalry in such a peculiar way can be considered a significant historical event. This original power deep in life has always been happening, and we were lucky enough to have been spared, but witnessing it happening now makes us feel the power that is overwhelmingly desperate, capable of destroying everything mercilessly. The production effect of this film is very good, the details are rich, the plot is compelling, and the audience is brought into this complicated and strange case itself.
