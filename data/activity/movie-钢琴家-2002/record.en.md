Facing destiny with melancholy and no resistance, struggling to survive amid the ruins. Fortunately, having some talent, was repeatedly favored and rescued by those who value it. Witnessing so many horrific moments and still being able to survive is extremely lucky. A wonderful war autobiographical film with a steady and powerful rhythm.
