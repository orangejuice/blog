        Via tw jiayuan. Re-read many books in 2022 and among them, The Almanack
        of Naval Ravikant is the one I recommend the most.


        I have already read the English version at the beginning of 2021 and
        recently re-read it. Initially, you may find many of the maxims in it
        meaningful, but only after truly practicing them you will understand
        their profound implications.


        Naval’s two core life philosophies: evolution + rational buddhism, the
        former refers to genes, the latter is to combat genes through
        introspection.

Naval’s two core life philosophies: evolution + rational buddhism, the former refers to genes, the latter is to combat genes through introspection. Don't cooperate with those who are cynical and pessimistic, their prophecy will be self-fulfilling.
