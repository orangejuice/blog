      comment: "Via tw jiayuan Revisited many books in 2022, and 'The Naval Codex' is
        the one I recommend the most. I had already read the English version in
        early 2021 and recently re-read it. Many of the maxims initially make
        sense, but only through true practice can one grasp their deeper
        meanings. Naval's two key life philosophies: Evolutionary theory +
        Rational Buddhism; the former pertains to genes, while the latter
        involves using introspection to combat genetic predispositions."
