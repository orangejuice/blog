  title: Prisoners of Geography
  subtitle: Tim Marshall / 2015 / Elliott & Thompson
  intro: >-
    In the bestselling tradition of Why Nations Fail and The Revenge of
    Geography, an award-winning journalist uses ten maps of crucial regions to
    explain the geo-political strategies of the world powers.

    All leaders of nations are constrained by geography. Their choices are
    limited by mountains, rivers, seas, and concrete. To understand world
    events, news organizations and other authorities often focus on people,
    ideas, and political movements, but without geography, we never have the
    full picture. Now, in the relevant and timely Prisoners of Geography,
    seasoned journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the USA, Latin
    America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan and Korea, and Greenland and
    the Arctic—their weather, seas, mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders—to
    provide a context often missing from our political reportage: how the
    physical characteristics of these countries affect their strengths and
    vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders.

    In ten, up-to-date maps of each region, Marshall explains in clear and
    engaging prose the complex geo-political strategies of these key parts of
    the globe. What does it mean that Russia must have a navy, but also has
    frozen ports six months a year? How does this affect Putin’s treatment of
    the Ukraine? How is China’s future constrained by its geography? Why will
    Europe never be united? Why will America never be invaded? Shining a light
    on the unavoidable physical realities that shape all of our aspirations and
    endeavors, Prisoners of Geography is the critical guide to one of the major
    (and most often overlooked) determining factors in world history.
