The Mobile Mind, a work by Anders Hansen, a psychiatrist from Sweden, views from the perspective of 'evolutionary psychology', points out that human brains and bodies are still in a state of adapting to primitive tribal life, and our daily habit of spending more than 4 hours on mobile phones imposes a great burden on the brain. The theories it proposes such as the scarcity of attention, the brain not adapted to modern life, and social networks exploiting human weaknesses are not novel, but the information provided still has some reference value. The book is not thick and can be read easily.
