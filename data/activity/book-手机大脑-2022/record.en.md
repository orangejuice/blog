via Twitter Fengying. A work from Swedish psychiatrist Anders Hansen titled 'The Mobile Mind'. From the perspective of 'evolutionary psychology', it points out that the human brain and body remain adapted to the primitive tribal life, and our current lifestyle of spending over 4 hours a day on smartphones imposes a significant burden on the brain. The theories mentioned such as scarcity of attention, the brain's maladaptation to modern life, and social networks exploiting human frailties are not novel, but the information provided still holds some reference value. The book is not thick and can be easily read.
