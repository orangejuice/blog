      comment: A quirky film, made on a shoestring budget, with unfiltered, simplistic
        visuals that resemble the ramblings of a storybook or an NPC in a game.
        It features pure, kind, calm, and persistent boys and other children,
        strangely merging with the bizarre world of adults. The film vividly
        portrays the hustle and bustle of society, poverty, and a hierarchical
        system of respect based on false identities, mercilessly slaughtering
        the development of a healthy personality day after day. The movie
        intentionally creates a sense of calm; everyone is incredibly calm,
        peacefully living within this framework, even a child who returns home
        in the middle of the night after being away for half a day faces no
        harsh punishment. This calmness is better described as numbness, where
        anything that happens to anyone is just so. The film is romantic, so
        romantic that a flower unexpectedly falls out of a crumpled notebook in
        a dilapidated classroom, a cute little yellow flower that is completely
        out of place with the soil.
