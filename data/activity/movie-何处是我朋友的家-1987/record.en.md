A quirky film with a low budget and simple production featuring unaugmented, filter-free visuals that seem straight out of a storybook or reminiscent of NPCs in a video game. The world blends bizarrely with the pure, good, and steadfast boy and other children in it, contrasting sharply with the strange world of the adults. This film vividly portrays the daily grind of society, poverty, and the merciless class hierarchy based on false pretenses that brutally stifles the development of a healthy personality. The movie deliberately creates a sense of calm; everyone exists in tranquil acceptance, even a child returning home in the middle of the night faces no harsh punishment. This calmness might better be described as numbness, where anything that happens to anyone is just another occurrence. The film is romantic, so much so that a flower can fall out of a crumpled homework notebook in a dilapidated classroomâ€”a small yellow flower, charming yet utterly out of place.
