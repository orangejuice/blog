It's a pretty good movie, but compared to the original, there are some slightly impetuous changes. The elements of sentimentality and preaching may be too common in modern times to feel appropriate in this film. The child actors are amazing, adorable. Dickon is quite different from the imagination, followed by Mary, Colin is the most appropriate. It's not quite perfect.
