A pretty good movie, although some changes from the original book are a bit hasty. The melodramatic and moralizing elements seem too common today and feel rather jarring in this film. The child actors are amazing and adorable. The character of Dickon was quite different than expected, Mary a bit less so, and Colin was most accurate. Not exactly perfect.
