Via Twitter, Ignatius Lee mentioned that movies like Kobayashi Masaki's 1965 film 'Kwaidan' and Akira Kurosawa's later film 'Dreams' are among the most irresistibly bizarre films for him. Even for 'A Ship on Land', which he regards as the everlasting number one in film history, he wouldn't watch it as often and still finds 'Dreams' endlessly fascinating.

I can't explain why I love such bizarre things. I neither like horror films nor surrealism ones. But Japanese bizarre films seem to perfectly satisfy my imagination about East Asian history.

When Eastern Asians tell ghost and monster tales, it's not just for sensory thrill; it's always embedded with deep emotions and clear moral ethics. Ghosts and monsters seem to have more humanity. Perhaps the ideal state of being is to become one of these supernatural beings.
