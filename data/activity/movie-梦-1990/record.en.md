Movies like "Kwaidan", directed by Masaki Kobayashi in 1965, and "Dreams", directed by Akira Kurosawa in his later years, are truly among the most irresistible strange films for me. Even a movie like "A Ship Bound for Land", which I consider the greatest film in history, I wouldn't watch as many times and still never tire of it. 

I can't explain why I like strange things so much. In fact, I don't particularly like horror films, nor do I like surreal films. But Japanese strange films seem to fully satisfy my entire imagination of East Asian history. 

When East Asians tell ghost stories, it's not just for sensory stimulation, as these tales always involve deep affection and clear moral ethics. Ghosts and other creatures are more human than humans. Maybe the ideal form of humanity is to become these supernatural beings.
