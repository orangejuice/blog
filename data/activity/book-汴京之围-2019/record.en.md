Finished reading 'The Collapse of a Prosperous Age' in the middle of the night. In the epilogue, I discovered that the author Guo Jianlong is actually a programmer. However, I found on Twitter that indeed many programmers enjoy reading history. This book is as engaging as 'Siege of Bianjing' and is recommended for those interested in the history of the Tang Dynasty.
