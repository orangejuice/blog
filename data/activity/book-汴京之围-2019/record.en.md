Via tw hank zhao, I finished reading 'The Collapse of the Prosperous Era' in the middle of the night. I was surprised to find out that the author Guo Jianlong is actually a programmer. However, I did find that many programmers like to read history on Twitter. This book is as enjoyable to read as 'Siege of Bianjing', recommended for those interested in Tang Dynasty history.
