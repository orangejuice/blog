A Twitter user mentioned wanting to see how American conservatives narrate American history â€“ which has led me to this intriguing book! Thomas Woods, a researcher at the Mises Institute and a doctorate holder from Columbia University, has written a book titled 'Alternative American History: The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History.' Just by its title, you can anticipate its content; examining it side by side with the standard textbooks, it's quite fascinating.
