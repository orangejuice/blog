Via Twitter, a user（bad translation 'CrowDoveCrow'）wanted to see how American conservatives discuss the history of the United States~

Here it is, a remarkable book!

Thomas Woods, a Mises Institute scholar and PhD from Columbia University, wrote a book titled 'The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History.' Just by the name, you can guess what he aims to write about; it's quite intriguing to compare it with official textbooks.
