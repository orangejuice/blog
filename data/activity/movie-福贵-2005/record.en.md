After watching the first episode, my impression is that the lines are too immature, and the acting is not vivid, whether it's the close-ups or the setting, none of them can draw me in. Especially, the main actor can't hold up the character, I can't see any soul in him. His actions and manner are identically amateurish as the magic phone. In every aspect, this is not a mature work, maybe I expected too much from the high ratings and that led to my disappointment, the poor picture quality may also be a factor. For now, I will put it aside and go back to reading.
