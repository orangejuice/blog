After watching the first episode, the impression is that the character dialogue is too immature, and the acting is not lively. Neither the close-ups of the characters nor the set conveys any sense of immersion. In particular, the leading young master cannot carry the role and lacks soul. His mannerisms are exactly like a fantasy mobile phone. Overall, it does not come across as a mature work, perhaps because the expectations were too high based on the high ratings, leading to disappointment. The poor picture quality is probably also a factor. Setting it aside for now, I'll go back to reading books honestly.
