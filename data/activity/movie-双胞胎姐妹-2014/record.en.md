      comment: What touched me so much? It was the love I never had and never will!
        Life is so wonderful! Love is so precious and indispensable! How sad is
        a life without love, like spending a lifetime suffering in prison!

2019-12-2 / 2023-12-25 Deeply moving. I admire the skill of the crew for handling this subject matter perfectly. The overflowing love and destinies that make us sigh repeatedly on-screen show that what these twin sisters bring to us goes far beyond being abandoned and raised separately. The serene beauty of Norway combined with the hustle of California, they share love and freedom, cherished and cared for, connected across the great expanse of the sea, their outgoing confidence and resilience aren't just gifts of genetics. Fate is everywhere, everywhere poignant.
