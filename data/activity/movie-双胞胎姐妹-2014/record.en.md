      comment: What touched me so much is the love that I will never have!! How
        wonderful life is! How precious and indispensable love is! How pitiful a
        life without love is, like giving you a lifetime but suffering in
        prison!

A deep emotion from December 2, 2019, to December 25, 2023. I admire the skill of the crew. They have brought out the best in this topic. The love that overflowed from the screen, and the fate that made one sigh again and again made what these twin sisters brought to us much more than simply being abandoned and going their separate ways. The calm and majestic Norway, the noisy California, they are sharing ample love and freedom. They are valued and cared for, connected across the ocean. Their extroversion, confidence, and determination are not merely gifts of genes. Everywhere is fate, everywhere is poignant.
