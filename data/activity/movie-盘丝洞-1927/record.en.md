The utter silence of the silent film makes these remaining fragments of celluloid from an age of colossal change all the more mysterious and tantalizingly reticent, captivating the viewer. What scenes and emotions did 1927 hold, what were in the thoughts of those pictured, what poetic wild desires did people harbor a century ago? All these emotions, neatly tied up, are a sight to behold.
