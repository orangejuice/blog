The ultimate tranquility of the silent film makes these remnants of a film reel that has experienced many changes over time even more mysterious and fascinating, as if they are about to say something but stop short. In 1927, what was the emotional background, what was the scenery, what was on the minds of the people in the picture. The wild imaginations of desire of people from a hundred years ago are enchanting. Ten thousand threads of emotions have been tidied up and presented in a clean and clear manner, giving watchers such a perspective.
