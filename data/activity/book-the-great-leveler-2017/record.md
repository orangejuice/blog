  title: The Great Leveler
  subtitle: Walter Scheidel / 2017 / Princeton University Press
  intro: >-
    Are mass violence and catastrophes the only forces that can seriously
    decrease economic inequality? To judge by thousands of years of history, the
    answer is yes. Tracing the global history of inequality from the Stone Age
    to today, Walter Scheidel shows that inequality never dies peacefully.
    Periods of increased equality are usually born of carnage and disaster and
    are generally short-lived, disappearing with the return of peace and
    stability. The Great Leveler is the first book to chart the crucial role of
    violent shocks in reducing inequality over the full sweep of human history
    around the world.

    Ever since humans began to farm, herd livestock, and pass on their assets to
    future generations, economic inequality has been a defining feature of
    civilization. Over thousands of years, only violent events have
    significantly lessened inequality. The "Four Horsemen" of
    leveling—mass-mobilization warfare, transformative revolutions, state
    collapse, and catastrophic plagues—have repeatedly destroyed the fortunes of
    the rich. Scheidel identifies and examines these processes, from the crises
    of the earliest civilizations to the cataclysmic world wars and communist
    revolutions of the twentieth century. Today, the violence that reduced
    inequality in the past seems to have diminished, and that is a good thing.
    But it casts serious doubt on the prospects for a more equal future.

    An essential contribution to the debate about inequality, The Great Leveler
    provides important new insights about why inequality is so persistent—and
    why it is unlikely to decline anytime soon.
