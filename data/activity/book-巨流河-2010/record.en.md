2022-07-15 Via tw Tingyun Every teacher should seriously read "River of the Colossus," especially Chapter 3 "China Shall Not Perish for I Am Here—Nankai High School." My eyes were moist throughout the reading. / 2023-12-19 via tw wuyagege / via tw dr.wang At 1 AM on March 28, well-known Taiwanese writer and scholar Qi Bangyuan passed away at the age of 100. Initially viewed in the mainland's edited version, it was deep and understated, melancholic yet not hurtful, showcasing a noble dignity rare in those tumultuous times of war, which was profoundly shocking. Later, I came across the Taiwan version - "River of the Colossus and the Silent Sea, are the real river and bay at the ends of my life, both literal and symbolic."
