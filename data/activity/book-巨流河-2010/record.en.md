      comment: Via tw Cloudstop Every educator should read carefully 'River of Time',
        especially the third chapter 'I am the reason China is not destroyed --
        Nankai Middle School'. While reading this work, I was always moved to
        tears.

While reading this work, I was always moved to tears. / 2023-12-19 via tw wuyagege / via tw dr.wang At 1 a.m. on March 28, the renowned Taiwanese writer and scholar, Qi Bangyuan, passed away at the age of 100 ~

When I first read the cut version on the mainland, it was deep and restrained, sorrow without hurt, especially showing a noble dignity which was rare to find during the chaotic days of refuge due to war. It was very shocking. Later, I got to read the Taiwanese version ~

'The River of Time and the Bay of Silence are real river and bay located at both ends of my life. They represent truth and symbolize meaning.'
