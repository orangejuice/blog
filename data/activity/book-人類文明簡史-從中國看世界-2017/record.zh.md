  title: 人類文明簡史：從中國看世界
  subtitle: 馮以浤 / 2017 / 香港城市大學出版社
  intro: >-
    歷史是人類文明承傳的紀錄。學習歷史不但可以鑑古知今，還可以提高我們對人文活動的認識和關懷。香港現在的歷史教育把中國歷史和世界歷史劃分為兩個互不統屬的科目，但世界上沒有一個國家是完全孤立的，它的歷史也不可能不受到其他地區的影響。因此，我們應全面地看它們的關係和發展的過程。
    本書以中國為經、世界其他地區為緯，嘗試把人類錯綜複雜的歷史整合起來，構成一幅比較完整的圖畫，讓讀者看到先祖的起源和人類的發展。全書記述的歷史跨度宏大全面，從史前到現代，從中國到世界，從人類文明的起源到朝代的興替，是一本普及版世界歷史書籍。

    本書特別適合中學生、大學生及對中外歷史有興趣的讀者閱讀。

    History is the record of the inheritance of human civilization. Studying
    history not only enables us to know the present by looking at the past but
    also heightens our understanding of and concern for humanistic activities.
    The education system in Hong Kong separates Chinese history and World
    history into two unrelated subjects. However, no country in the world is
    totally isolated whose history could be impervious to the influence of other
    nations. We must comprehensively take into full account these relationships
    and their process of development.

    A matrix is used in this book to present the rather complicated historical
    materials of human history, with the vertical axis representing the Chinese
    civilization and the horizontal axis those of other nations, in an attempt
    to reconstruct a comparatively complete picture so as to present to the
    reader the origin of our ancestors and the progress of humankind. The
    history encompassed is vast and comprehensive, from prehistory to that of
    Modern times, from China to the world, from the origin of human civilization
    to the rise and fall of dynasties. This is, in scope, a world history for
    the general reader.

    The book is especially suitable for secondary school and university students
    as well as people interested in Chinese and world history.
