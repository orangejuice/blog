Via tw Su_liang discovered an extraordinary book, that explains 'The Art of War' by Sun Tzu in a splendid and refined manner. Previously, whenever I tried to comprehend the original version of 'The Art of War', I was left confused as the notes were too brief and I would easily lose interest in reading further. 

The author of 'Art of Deception in Warfare' quotes numerous references, elaborating Sun Tzu's thoughts from various different perspectives with a wealth of information.
