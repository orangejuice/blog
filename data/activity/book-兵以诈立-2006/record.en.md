Via Twitter, Su Liang discovered a fascinating book that interprets Sun Tzu's "Art of War" in an incredibly vivid and insightful manner. Previously, delving into the original "Art of War" was always confusing; its annotations are too brief and easily sap the interest of the reader.

The author of "Warfare Established by Deception" supports his explanations with an abundance of materials, thoroughly elucidating Sun Tzu's thoughts from various perspectives.
