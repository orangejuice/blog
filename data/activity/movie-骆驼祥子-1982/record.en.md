This film touches the soul! The shooting techniques are slightly immature, but it does not hide its merits. On the contrary, it highlights the actors' dedication. The casting is a great success. The historical background of the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, and the shaping of the characters' destinies, all are incredibly moving. The pipa sweeps across, striking a chord that brings tears to the eyes. In the troubled times, the system is rigid and plagued by internal and external troubles. Society is dysfunctional, the rich are aloof, and the terribly poor people sell their bodies for a bite to eat. This work observes, laments, and questions the society of the time, making me spontaneously imagine how many sorrowful hearts have read and watched it, and then shed tears. I admire Lao She. Modernity always makes me feel alienated, empty in my heart, and ungrounded. In contrast, the spiritual connotation and the breath of life of the art works from the 1980s make me feel they are real, alive, curious, and questioning.
