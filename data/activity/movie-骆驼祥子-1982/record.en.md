This film is soul-stirring! The cinematography is somewhat raw, yet it does not conceal its gems, rather, it highlights the actors' dedicated performances. The casting is a great success. The portrayal of the turbulent times of the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, along with the fate of its characters, is incredibly poignant, capable of sweeping one into tears with just a flick of a pipa. In an era of rigid systems fraught with internal and external crises, where society malfunctioned, the affluent reigned supreme while the destitute sold their labor for mere sustenance. This work's profound observation of the society at the time, its lament and interrogation, made it impossible not to imagine the many troubled souls who, upon reading or viewing, were moved to tears. I admire Lao She deeply. Modern times often alienate me, leaving a void insideâ€”unstable and detached in contrast to the spirit and breath of life inherent in the art of the 80s, which feels alive, full of blood and flesh, curious, and questioning.
