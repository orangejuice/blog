Via Twitter @yangpigui 2019 Norwegian/German documentary 'War of Art', directed by Tommy Gulliksen. Seven artists from different countries visit North Korea for an art exchange. Amid expected censorship, 'escorts', and political spectacles, the details of conversations between the artists, their escorts, North Korean art workers, and ordinary people they meet are quite interesting. The 'report performance' at the time of departure is hilariously poignant. Of course, the editing is also an eye-opener.
