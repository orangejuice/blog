via tw xone This book was recommended before, but it took a long time to find the original post. Very exciting. Excerpt: The Soviet Union agreed to use 17 submarines, a cruiser, a frigate, and a destroyer as exchange conditions for purchasing Pepsi Cola... Naval ships sold as scrap, the chairman of Pepsi Cola company once jokingly said to the White House: 'We disarm the Soviet Union faster than you.'
