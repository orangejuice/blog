All flash, no substance; shrouded in pretentious mystery with little to offer. The arrangement of actors feels overly contrived, and the technology seems to serve more as a showcase than supporting the content, comprising mostly pompous displays. A rather impatient documentary. However, it's not entirely without merit; perhaps the film was intended to satisfy those looking for quirky, entertaining content.
