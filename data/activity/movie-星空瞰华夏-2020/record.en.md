This film is ostentatious and feigns a sense of mystery, offering little substantial content. The arrangement of the actors is noticeably hasty, and instead of serving the content, 80% of the technique seems to only show off. It is a rather impatiently made documentary. Yet, it is not completely worthless as perhaps the movie was made to satisfy the whims of those seeking novelty entertainment.
