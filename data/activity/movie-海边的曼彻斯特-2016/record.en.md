      comment: Via weixin knowyourself /tw keke from 勇往直前 2023-08 / via tw Zoey The
        first anti-inspirational film of the year. A heartbreaking film, or in
        internet language, a depressing film. The pace of the film is slow, long
        shots and minimal dialogue, very much like a prose poem spoken in
        silence. The film has little intense conflict, no unexpected turn of
        events, but it resonates with the present moment. This film does not
        have the warm redemption of Hollywood films, and the protagonist does
        not return to the right path, instead he rejects, rejects spiritual
        liberation, and rejects reconciliation with his past. Time cannot heal
        everything! This is a film that made me feel depressed and suffocated
        after seeing it, but I will keep on watching it. No reason. This
        depressing and collapsed film won the Oscar. Because it is real enough,
        all the trivial matters of life and the details of life's sadness happen
        at the same time, generating a great energy, those knots that hit the
        heart, no need to unravel.

Life is a joke. An ineradicable sadness, a crumbling moment in the trifles. The cinematographic language of poor communication between people is impressive. The pacing is good, delving into the inner world of a broken person and capturing subtle clues and emotions. Like the protagonist's voice, full of existential exhaustion.
