      comment: "Via WeChat 'knowyourself' and Twitter @ keke from 'Forward Bound'
        (August 2023) / via Twitter @ Zoey, the first anti feel-good movie of
        the year: A heartbreaking film, a sorrowful movie as described in
        internet slang. The pacing is slow, with long takes and minimal
        dialogue, almost a silent prose poem in its eloquence. The movie almost
        lacks intense conflicts or unexpected twists, but it resonates with the
        current moment. This film lacks the warm redemption typical of Hollywood
        movies. The protagonist does not return to the right path, but instead
        refusesâ€”refuses to find solace in his soul, refuses to reconcile with
        his past. Time does not heal everything! Watching this movie left me
        feeling depressed and suffocated, but I'll continue watching. There's no
        particular reason why. This movie's crushing sorrow and breakdown,
        despite being so, won the Academy Award for its raw truthfulness. The
        intricacies of everyday sadness and trivial adversities occur
        simultaneously, creating immense energy, untying heartstrings without
        needing to be resolved."

Life is a joke. The lingering melancholy, the moments of breakdown in the trivialities. The impression of miscommunication through cinematography is profound. The pacing is well-managed, delving deeply into the crumbling adult psyche, capturing subtle clues and emotions. I like the protagonist's voice, full of world-weariness.
