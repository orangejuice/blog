Via tw philo / via tw cydiar We love others, perhaps only loving the self reflected in their eyes. "Is the Narcissus boy beautiful?" the lake asked. "Who knows this better than you?" the forest goddess replied in surprise, "He is by your side every day." The lake was silent for a while, and finally spoke, "I weep for the Narcissus boy, yet I never noticed his appearance. I weep for him because every time he faces me, I can see my own beautiful reflection deep in his eyes."
