  title: Twilight in the Forbidden City
  subtitle: Reginald F. Johnston / 1988 / Oxford Paperbacks
  intro: Reginald Fleming Johnston was a British colonial officer, scholar and a
    writer with a passion for China and Chinese culture. From 1919 to 1924 he
    was tutor and adviser to the last emperor of China. The emperor P'u-i had
    abdicated his throne in 1912. However, in order to ensure a rapid and
    peaceful transfer of authority, he was allowed to retain his title and was
    permitted to remain in residence. Johnston was able to observe and chronicle
    the last years of the Ch'ing dynasty.
