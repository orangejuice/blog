The actors are extraordinary, with each role deeply ingrained into themselves, allowing gentleness and toughness to collide together, those personalities clearly displayed on the screen. That man who is full of gentleness and an open heart, that man who is isolated, closed off and selfish. But they are all people, they all need love.
