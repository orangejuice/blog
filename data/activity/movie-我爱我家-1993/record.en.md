      comment: Currently watched up to episode ten, tears of emotion swirling in my
        eyes. So real, so realistic. A superb script, artistic performances, and
        dialogue delivery, culminating with a production release by the China
        International Cultural Arts Center. Why has it come to this, alas. It’s
        quite heart-wrenching.

Currently watched up to episode ten, tears of emotion swirling in my eyes. So real, so realistic. A superb script, artistic performances, and dialogue delivery, culminating with a production release by the China International Cultural Arts Center. Why has it come to this, alas. It’s quite heart-wrenching. /e83 Occasionally watching an episode is refreshing and beautiful /e85 e86 A satirical busybody risking it all for a clever ploy, only for others to reap the benefits /e97 98 'A mistake from your grandfather, and mine is begging' – Watching more makes me feel the scriptwriting and comedic elements aren’t particularly clever, probably just sincere and touching. The special circumstances of the time make this sincerity all the more precious /e103 Exaggerated and pretentious. By today,finished watching all 130 episodes without missing any. Honestly, what's most captivating after seeing the entire series is a kind of avant-garde and rarely seen personality, openness in various aspects – in thinking, perspective, and towards the audience. Willing to try, to strive, grounded in the past, looking forward to the future. Although the script’s foundation and comedic style haven’t reached the pinnacle, the unique spirit of that era is quite compelling.
