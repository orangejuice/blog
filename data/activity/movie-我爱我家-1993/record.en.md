      comment: Currently watching up to episode 10, the tears of emotion are spinning
        in my eyes. So real, so realistic. Brilliant script, artistic
        performance, and dialogue presentation, finally emerging from the China
        International Culture and Arts Center's production and distribution. How
        did it get to this point? Heart-wrenchingly so.

Currently watching up to episode 10, the tears of emotion are spinning in my eyes. So real, so realistic. Brilliant script, artistic performance, and dialogue presentation, finally emerging from the China International Culture and Arts Center's production and distribution. How did it get to this point? Heart-wrenchingly so. Occasionally watching an episode is fresh and beautiful. Satire of the hustle and bustle, risking little cleverness, ended up making a wedding dress for others. 'One mistake by your grandfather and my grandfather will starve.' The more you watch, the less brilliant the script creation and comedic tactics seem to be, probably just sincerely touching, the special time and space make this honesty more precious. Exaggerated vanity. Today, 130 episodes have finally been watched without missing any. Honestly, the most fascinating part of the whole film is a kind of avant-garde and rare character, openness in various senses, openness of thought, openness of vision, openness to the audience. Willing to try, willing to work hard, based on the past, looking forward to the future. Although the dialogue skills and comedic forms have not reached the pinnacle, it does not obscure the unique spirit of that era, which is very attractive.
