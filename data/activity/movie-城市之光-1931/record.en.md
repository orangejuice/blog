Perhaps a great work is just like this. Humorous and optimistic on the surface, but beneath it lies the struggle and weariness of the common people. In this modern city, a forgetful rich man, and a crowd thatâ€™s densely packed yet unrelated, busy gawking and gossiping, comforting themselves. Amidst this desolation, the brief friendship of the wealthy man and the pure love of the beautiful flower girl shine like faint, warm twinkling stars. The greatness of this comical character is deeply sympathetic.
