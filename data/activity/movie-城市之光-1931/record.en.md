Great works are probably like this. Humorous and optimistic, under a positive shell, everywhere are the struggles of ordinary people, powerless and exhausted. The modern city, the forgetful rich, crowded but irrelevant, spectators who gossip and make fun to comfort themselves. In this desolation, the temporary friendship of the rich and the pure love of the beautiful flower girl shine with faint warmth. The greatness of this comic character is very sympathetic.
