Today is a special day: I finally finished reading the Chinese version of this book. Its sweeping views, ways of thinking, calm rationality, and vast knowledge are just a few of the many admirable things about it. It is a serious work, but also a good one. I dare say no one studying Chinese history can bypass this book. It's hard to read, not to mention how hard it must have been to write. It took me 2 months to read half in Chinese and half in English, and even 2 years might not be enough to fully grasp the content within.
