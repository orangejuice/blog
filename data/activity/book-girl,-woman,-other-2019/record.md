  title: Girl, Woman, Other
  subtitle: Bernardine Evaristo / 2019 / Hamish Hamilton
  intro: >-
    Teeming with life and crackling with energy - a love song to modern Britain
    and black womanhood

    Girl, Woman, Other follows the lives and struggles of twelve very different
    characters. Mostly women, black and British, they tell the stories of their
    families, friends and lovers, across the country and through the years.

    Joyfully polyphonic and vibrantly contemporary, this is a gloriously new
    kind of history, a novel of our times: celebratory, ever-dynamic and utterly
    irresistible.

    'A daring evocation of black British history... Sexy, punchy [and] fresh'
    Independent on Sunday on The Emperor's Babe
