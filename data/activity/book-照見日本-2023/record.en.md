Via tw Tulaire Ding, I've been reading 'Seeing Japan: From the Meiji Era to the Modern Times, A 150-Year History of Japanese Tourism Seen and Being Seen.' This book narrates the history of Japan from a tourism perspective. It's quite amusing to note that, just like Japan, China (during the Qing Dynasty) set up a passport system allowing foreigners to travel within China, whereas Japan (under the Shogunate) flatly refused to allow foreigners to travel there.
