Recently, Via tw 图拉鼎 has been reading this book, 'Viewing Japan: Seeing and Being Seen, A 150-Year History of Japanese Tourism from the Meiji Era to the Present', from a touristic perspective. When reading this part of the book, it was found fascinating that while China (Qing Dynasty) at that time established the passport system, allowing foreigners to travel to China, Japan (the Shogunate) firmly refused to allow foreigners to travel in Japan.
