As suggested by a random internet user, 'Evolutionary Psychology' is a book that thoroughly reveals the essence of male-female relationships. Authored by David M. Buss. Some have proposed that at a wedding, the newlyweds should not swear their vows with their hands on the bible. Instead, they should place their hands on 'Evolutionary Psychology' and 'The Selfish Gene', and pledge: I will go against my nature, defy my instincts, and love you forever.
