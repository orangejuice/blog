The expression is very stiff; it's been a while since I've seen something this rigid. The acting is pretentious, trying to appear fierce, but suddenly a pure smile throws me out of the scene. The characters are hollow, as far as the eye can see, thereâ€™s no soul in anyone, just a bunch of people making noise without reason. The theme might be good, but it failed to keep me seated and engaged. It made me aware of the Tibetan antelope issue from the last century.
