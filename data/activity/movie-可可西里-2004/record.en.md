The expression is too rigid, I haven't seen something this stiff for a long time. The acting is pretentious; trying to act tough, but a sudden innocent smile throws me out of the play. The characters are hollow, and I can't see the soul of anyone where I look, just a bunch of people making noise for no reason. The theme may be good, but it couldn't keep me seated or draw me in. I now know that there was a Tibetan antelope incident in the last century.
