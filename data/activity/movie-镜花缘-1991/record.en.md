It's truly a unique romance of that era. Although it's not exquisite, I still wanted to finish watching it, full of the imprint of the times. I have actually seen 'Two-Faced Person' and the impression is deep. I saw on YouTube that some Chinese teachers recommended watching it, but it's really not necessary, the subtitles, picture and sound quality are unclear, the content expression is also very implied, although free to play but immature, just keep it for self-indulgence.
