Truly unique to that era's romance. Although not exquisite, it's still worth watching to the end, replete with hallmarks of its time. The 'Two-faced Character' is surprisingly memorable. I saw a Chinese teacher recommending this on YouTube, which really isn't necessary; the video is unclear without subtitles, and the quality of both picture and sound are poor. The content is subtly expressed, though freely developed, it's immature. Just indulge for a bit and move on.
