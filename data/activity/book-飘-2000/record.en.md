Via Weibo From Stefan Zweig's death in the world of yesterday, I reread 'Gone with the Wind'. Reaching the part where Scarlett O'Hara marries Rhett Butler, 'When she lazily lay in Rhett's arms, bathed in moonlight that washed over the bed, she would think how wonderful it would be if she were so close to Ashley's arms instead, if it was Ashley's hand scattering her black hair across his face, winding around his neck. Once, recalling this brought a sigh, and she turned to look out the window. After a while, she felt the strong arm beneath her neck stiffen like iron, and in the silence Rhett's voice came: 'May God damn you to hell, you little cheat!' Suddenly, I realized that the entire character setup in Qiong Yao's 'A Dream in Red Mansions' came from here, that Fei Yunfan is indeed Rhett Butler!
