Via Weibo, reflecting on 昨日世界 (Yesterday's World) by Cizweige who passed away, I revisited 'Gone with the Wind'. The narrative reached Scarlett marrying Rhett and she lay lazily in Rhett's arms in the moonlight, pondering about how great it would be if the arm she was lying on was Ashley's arm, if it was Ashley whose hand tousled her black hair, entwined around his neck. On one occasion, she sighed at these thoughts and turned to gaze at the window. After a while, she felt Rhett's arm underneath her neck stiffen like iron and his voice echoed in the silence: 'May God damn you, you little fraud,'. It suddenly struck me that this entire character was how Qiong Yao's 'Dream Behind the Curtain' was setup, Fraction Yufan is Rhett butler!
