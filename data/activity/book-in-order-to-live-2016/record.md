  title: In Order To Live
  subtitle: Yeonmi Park / 2016 / Penguin
  intro: >-
    'I am most grateful for two things: that I was born in North Korea, and that
    I escaped from North Korea.'

    Yeonmi Park was not dreaming of freedom when she escaped from North Korea.
    She didn't even know what it meant to be free. All she knew was that she was
    running for her life, that if she and her family stayed behind they would
    die - from starvation, or disease, or even execution.

    This book is the story of Park's struggle to survive in the darkest, most
    repressive country on earth; her harrowing escape through China's underworld
    of smugglers and human traffickers; and then her escape from China across
    the Gobi desert to Mongolia, with only the stars to guide her way, and from
    there to South Korea and at last to freedom; and finally her emergence as a
    leading human rights activist - all before her 21st birthday.
