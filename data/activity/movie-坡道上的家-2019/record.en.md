The story is overly tedious and long-winded, whether it's the characters or the advancement of the plot, everything proceeds at a snail's pace, significantly reducing the emotional impact. There's no suspense, just an anxious wait for the story's climax. I quickly watched from the start of the fifth episode, and the ending was an expected reunion. I might rate this drama 8 out of 10 at best. Of course, it's not to say that the issue the theme wants to reveal is not serious. Looking at the comments, many people have finally found an outlet to vent, there are too few works in this area. The topicality exceeds the enjoyment.
