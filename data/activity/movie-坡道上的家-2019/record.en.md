The story is too verbose and lengthy, with both characters and plot development slowly progressing, which significantly reduces its emotional impact. There's no real suspense, only a tense waiting for the climax of the story. I started to skip through the episodes from the fifth one, and the ending, as expected, was a predictable reunion. I might rate this show at most 8 out of 10. Thatâ€™s not to say the theme it seeks to reveal isn't severe. Reading the comments, it's clear that many people finally found an outlet for expression, a rarity in such works. The topicality outweighs its watchability.
