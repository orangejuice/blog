From what I have seen so far, I recommend the novels 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee and the short story collection 'Stories of Your Life' by Ted Chiang, as well as George Orwell's '1984'. For operatic poetry, the only divine works are Goethe's 'Faust' and 'The Ring of the Nibelung'. Recommended sociological works include Professor Ruskin's introductory text on comparative politics 'The Concept of the State' and Lazarsfeld's seminal work in communications 'The Peopleâ€™s Choice'.
