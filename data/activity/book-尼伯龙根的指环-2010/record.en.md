via tw white light, among all the works I've read, I recommend the novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee, the short story collection 'Stories of Your Life' by Ted Chiang, and '1984' by George Orwell. For opera, I recommend the sublime 'Faust' by Goethe, and 'The Ring of the Nibelung. For social science books, I’d suggest Professor Ruskin's introductory book on comparative politics 'Concepts of the Nation' and Lazarsfeld's masterpiece in mass communication studies 'People’s Choice’.
