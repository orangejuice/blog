  title: Can't Hurt Me
  subtitle: David Goggins / 2018 / Lioncrest Publishing
  intro: >-
    For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare - poverty, prejudice, and
    physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through
    self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed
    himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S.
    Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only
    man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and
    Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous
    endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him The Fittest (Real)
    Man in America.

    In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most
    of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40%
    Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past
    pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.
