From Twitter insights and actions: He is an African-American. As a child, he suffered from domestic violence and poverty, and he became obese due to depression-induced binge eating. His life seemed destined to be a loser, but he turned his fate around to become a record-breaking elite soldier in the US military and a world-class endurance athlete. He lived out a legendary story of immense mental resilience and physical limit-breaking. This book is my top choice for inspirational spiritual books.
