Seen through the lens of insight and action, he is an African American who experienced domestic violence and poverty as a child, and turned into an overweight man due to overeating caused by depression. It seemed his life was doomed to be a 'loser', but he flipped his destiny and became a super elite soldier breaking the records of the U.S. military and one of the top endurance athletes in the world. He lived out a legendary story of mental resilience and pushing the body's limits. This book is the top 1 spiritual motivational book in my mind.
