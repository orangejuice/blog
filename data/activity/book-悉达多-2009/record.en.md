        eyes is not you, the you in others' eyes is not you either. The others

via friend's recommendation / via Douban, Dou Xiao Dou: The self in your eyes is not you, the you in others' eyes is not you either. The others in your eyes are the real you.

— "Siddhartha" / via Twitter @HuangpuMemory Hesse said in "Siddhartha": In our lives, we must set out on our own journey, passing through phases of full ambition, doubt in adversity, arrogance and rudeness, worldly utilitarianism, love and unlove, sudden enlightenment, acceptance and understanding, passing through our own lives.
