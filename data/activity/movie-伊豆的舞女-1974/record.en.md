Love at first sight, and from then on, my heart only harbors endless yearning. Everything is exceptionally beautiful, with the play's actors not just being actors, but lively and interesting individuals. The excitement is beautiful, innocence is beautiful simplicity is beautiful, Akebono is beautiful, the male lead is beautiful. A strong influx of Japanese culture is evident, with soft music caressing the ears, decorum exalted, and order respected, the placement of every chess piece audible. What joy could surpass waiting by the window for the beloved to turn the corner? Listening to the tremulous sad melodies of Japanese songs makes one wish to forget everything, to become pure and simple, to lead a simple life undistracted. Parting with a loved one in this life with dignity and openness, sharing thoughts silently and without profanity, without tarnishing the truth, this is a textbook case, bringing tears like rain. The most heart-stirring, the most heartbreaking of this year.
