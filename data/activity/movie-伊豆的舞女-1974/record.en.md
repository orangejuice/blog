Love at first sight, and after that, the heart only held endless yearning. Everything was so beautiful, from the on-screen actors to the non-actors, to the vivid and interesting people. The stirring feelings were so beautiful, the innocence was so beautiful, the simplicity was so beautiful, the male lead was so beautiful. The full view of Japanese style coming into sight, the gentle music tickling the ears, the abundant etiquettes, the hierarchical order, each move in the game of Go making a sound. What joy could surpass waiting and seeing the person haunting your dreams appear around the corner. Listening to the tremblingly sorrowful Japanese tunes, one is only left wanting to forget everything else, to become purely gentle, to become incredibly simple, and to lead a life with a heart free from distractions. Saying goodbye to the person in one's heart in this life, solemnly and generously, expressing their feelings without any obscene or disrespectful words or tarnishing a shred of true emotions, is like a textbook, bringing me to tears. It was the most poignant, the most heart-breaking this year.
