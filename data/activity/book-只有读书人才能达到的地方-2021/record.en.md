The reading feels strange. While it talks about having depth, pursuing a deep life, the language of the book is coarse, and the organization of the text is quite superficial. Not to mention the lack of depth, even when citing examples to prove points, it lacks strength. The text remains at the level of a college entrance examination essay, which does not meet expectations.
