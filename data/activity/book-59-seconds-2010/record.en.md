In a study at the University of California, students were asked to spend a few minutes each day imagining they had achieved high scores and how good this made them feel. Another group of students was not asked to do anything. After recording the time students studied every day, the results showed - the students who imagined studied less than the other group, and their test scores were also lower, even though the imagination exercise only took a few minutes.
