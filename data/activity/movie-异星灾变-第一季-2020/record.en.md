      comment: "Currently up to episode seven, the script is weak, relying on
        communication barriers, mysticism, and metaphoric narrative to push the
        plot, making it unsmooth and unnatural. Characters are over-the-top and
        lack depth, just archetypes. Is it just an attempt to create a thrilling
        show for sheer excitement? It's tasteless yet a pity to abandon.. a 9/10
        rating is too high. The introduction raises questions like: What makes
        us human? What constitutes a family? What if we could start over and
        erase the chaos of our planet? Can we survive? Can we do better? - This
        series sets the bar too high, answering none of these questions, merely
        a commercial piece."
