      comment: "As of the seventh episode, the plot is weak, being propelled by
        communication barriers, mysticism, and metaphors. The development is not
        smooth or natural, and the characters are flamboyant, but not
        dimensional. Is it only intended to be an exhilarating show for the
        audience? It leaves a bland taste, but it's also regretful to abandon...
        A rating of 9 is too high. As for what was said in the introduction —
        'This drama also raises the following questions: What makes us human?
        What constitutes a family? What if we could start over and eliminate the
        chaos on our planet? Can we survive? Can we do better?' — That's a bit
        overrated. This show can't answer those questions, it's just a
        commercial film."
