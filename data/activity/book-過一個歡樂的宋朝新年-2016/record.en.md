I enjoyed it, and gained a comprehensive understanding of the overall process from Winter Solstice to Lantern Festival. The concepts of 'Kitchen God', spring couplets, and gambles and shopping were interesting. The slight melancholy when the lanterns come down at the end was quite thought-provoking.
