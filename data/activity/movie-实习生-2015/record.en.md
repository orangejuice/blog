Oddly, a film that should be delicate in its topic somehow failed to move me. I didn’t feel the warmth, the humor, or the tear-jerking moments. There’s an unreal feeling that persists; I always knew I was watching a purposefully made film, with attractive leads which barely kept me watching, but it felt too contrived.
