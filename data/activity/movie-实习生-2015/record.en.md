Strange. For a movie whose subject matter should be very delicate, I don't know why it didn't touch me. I wasn't moved, I didn't find it funny, it didn't bring me to tears. There's this unrealistic vibe. I've always known that I'm watching a movie made with intention. Both the old man and the female lead are very attractive, vaguely compelling me to continue watching, but it feels too deliberate.
