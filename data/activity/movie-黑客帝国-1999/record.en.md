A damn near perfect fusion of the mundane and the philosophical. It’s filled with clichéd, breath-takingly handsome men and beautiful women in love, cool fight scenes, a sexy female lead, and nerve-wracking thrilling moments, all mixed with interesting philosophies. In fact, the movie’s sensory perception is more clichéd mainstream cinema than thought-provoking; even the thinking has become secondary. A bizarrely unique film in its own right. The depiction of extraterrestrial life seems influenced by 'Alien,' which I checked and indeed came out in 1979—a truly fantastical last century.
