This is a truly damn near perfect combination of the worldly and philosophical. It's a clich√©d love story with stunningly handsome men and beautiful women, where the fights must be cool, the heroine must be sexy, and there are nerve-wracking suspenseful moments. All of this combined with such interesting philosophical thoughts. Actually, the commercial elements in the perception of this film are greater than the thinking, the thinking has even become a secondary thing. A very strange standalone movie. Was the portrayal of the unknown life influenced by Alien? Upon relooking, Alien is actually a product of 1979, such is the full-of-fantasy last century.
