A good documentary that isn't dry. The use of animation and palace location markers is impressive. Especially eye-opening was the earthquake test I saw for the first time in this film. Even a small building was fully enshrouded in traditional Chinese worldviews and philosophical concepts, vividly illustrating the fascinating relationship between softness and hardness, leaving endless room for imagination.
