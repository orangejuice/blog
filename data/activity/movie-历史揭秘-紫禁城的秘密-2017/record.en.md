A fine documentary that isnâ€™t dull, making good use of animation and well-marked palace locations. Especially eye-opening is the seismic test footage seen for the first time, depicting a small structure entirely enveloped in traditional Chinese worldviews and philosophical thoughts, vividly portraying the intriguing relationship between softness and rigidity, sparking endless imagination.
