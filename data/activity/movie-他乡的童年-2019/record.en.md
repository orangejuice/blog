Skimming the surface. Especially the final episode, which showed particular confusion in its self-observation. It captured fragments mixed into a jumbled mess, somewhat subpar, which began to cast doubts on whether the portrayal of other countries in the first four episodes was fair. However, many shots remain unique. It's not a serious documentary but more like a travel show. As a travel show, it does well to ponder and seek out educational differences, which is quite commendable and offers substantial insights. More such works would be beneficial, encouraging viewers to reflect on the ideals and practical differences in education, recognizing areas of deficiency and potential improvement to break away from traditional and rigid constraints. I really wish some country would earnestly produce a series on the global state of education, especially post-COVID, as it provides a critical entry point.
