Touching the surface like a dragonfly skimming across the water. Especially the last episode is particularly confusing in its self-observation, capturing a mixed potpourri of elements like a conjured porridge, somewhat disappointing, causing one to question whether the depiction of other countries in the first four episodes is fair. Yet many scenes are unique, and it doesn't feel like a serious documentary but more like a travel program. As a travel program, it does a great job of considering and exploring educational differences, yielding quite a few insights. We want more works like this, to make audiences think more about the philosophies and practice of education, to understand our shortcomings and areas for improvement, and to break free from constraining traditions and rigidity. How I wish there was a serious program from any country dedicated to creating a series of documentaries on the current state of international education, the world post-COVID would be an excellent starting point.
