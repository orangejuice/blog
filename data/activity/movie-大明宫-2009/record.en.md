The directing, screenplay, and music are all first-class, with substantive content and hardly any drag. It’s rare to see a domestic team producing work that matches international standards—a truly excellent piece. After watching the film and witnessing the cycles of prosperity and decline, one feels a profound sense of the vicissitudes of life, filled with mixed emotions. The world changes rapidly, in an endless cycle. Humanity erases its past and starts over, a process both lamentable and inevitable. It is hoped that our countrymen, in their lifetimes, can recreate cultural splendor, build a happy and dignified civic life internally, shed the heavy burden of history, and engage in international exchanges with a confident, well-educated, accommodating, and humble charm. To witness such a development in one's lifetime would indeed make it worthwhile.
