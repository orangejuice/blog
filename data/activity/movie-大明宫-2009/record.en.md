The acting, script, and music production are all first-rate, and the contents are substantial without being dragged out, rare commendable work from a domestic team, yet reaching international standards. After watching the film, seeing the cycles of prosperity and decline, one is filled with the feeling of the vicissitudes of the world, it's truly a mix of emotions. Constant changes, repeating cycles, humans start all over again by wiping out the past, lamentable and regrettable, but it's inevitable. I hope that the Chinese can recreate a brilliant culture in their lifetime, build a happy and dignified life for the citizens, cast off the heavy burden of history, and engage in international exchanges with self-confidence and humility. If one is fortunate enough to witness this, it would not be a wasted life.
