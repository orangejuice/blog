via tw songma, a good book. When discussing 'evolution' in China, Yan Fu cannot be bypassed. It was he who introduced the idea of evolution, albeit in a misunderstood way, to China. The theory of evolution has had a huge and immeasurable impact on the turning point of Chinese history. Leading intellectuals of the time, such as Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and Yan Fu, all used the theory of evolution to enlighten the Chinese literati. The book that fully discusses this historical process and its impact is 'China and Darwin'.
