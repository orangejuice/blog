via tw songma Excellent book. When discussing 'evolution' in China, Yan Fu is an inevitable figure, as he introduced evolutionary theory to China in a misunderstood way. The impact of evolution on the turning point of Chinese history was immeasurable. Leading intellectuals of the time such as Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and Yan Fu enlightened the Chinese literati with the theory of evolution. The book that fully explores this ideological history and impact is 'China and Darwin'.
