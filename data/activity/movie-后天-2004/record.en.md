The film projects the texture of a big American movie, with attentive special effects and a patchwork plot. It's one of the primary works that instilled in me an indelible apocalypse complex during my youth. Although I've forgotten the characters in the movie, I vividly recall the scenes of freezing and the post-disaster landscape. The quintessential love theme in an end-of-the-world film has subconsciously educated me, causing me to instantly think of my love whenever I think of the end of the world, unable to stop fantasizing about surviving the apocalypse together. Watching this film made me a little envious of such a heroic father.
