The film has the quality of American blockbusters, with very thoughtful special effects. The plot is quite patchy, but it still served as the forefront of my adolescence-induced apocalypse fixation. I've forgotten the characters in the movie, yet the scenes of instant freezing and post-disaster landscapes remain vivid in my memory. The inevitable romantic subplot in apocalypse-themed movies also subconsciously indoctrinated me, making it impossible not to think of someone I like when thinking of the end of the world, and fantasizing about surviving it together. Watching this film made me somewhat envious of having such a heroic father.
