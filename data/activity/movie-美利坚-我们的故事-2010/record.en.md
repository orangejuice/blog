The production is very mainstream, and some empty praises by guests are somewhat humorous to those who are familiar with this kind of rhetoric. The historical narrative is splendidly illustrated in the visuals. The future is unpredictable, standing at each moment, it's hard to imagine what America will become. The pace of growth from zero is too fast. Overall, individual power is fully capitalized. The affirmation of individual life, values, and pursuits is the foundation of America's founding and a contribution to human civilization. Moreover, the interpretation of this value is continually advancing. It is for this reason that America, unlike any other country, has led humanity into modern life, subtly affecting all aspects of human society.
