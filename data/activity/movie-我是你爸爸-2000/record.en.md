The expression and narrative ability of the characters and plot within the film is inferior. A clear contradiction between father and son is shown, with each setting up a defensive wall against the other. The acting of the father and son is passable, but they seem to be posturing more within and outside the play, lacking human soul. The audience cannot empathize, and do not produce emotions. The plot is disjointed, incomprehensible, and the viewing experience continuously diverts attention.
