The expression and narrative ability inside the play (character) and outside the play (plot) are poor. There's a clear portrayal of father-son conflict and the defensive walls they build against each other. The acting skills of the father and son are commendable, but it still feels like there's too much artificiality in and out of the play, lacking the soul of the characters. It's hard to empathize, doesn't evoke emotions, the storyline is disjointed and confusing, leading to a wandering mind throughout the viewing process.
