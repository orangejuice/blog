The successive appearances of various ceremonial celebrations are truly awe-inspiring. Each of human civilization and culture has developed unique rituals and celebrations tightly associated with its own tribe and culture, carrying a great intrinsic power connecting to the ancestors in the course of the activities. It guides individuals to form their own understanding of the meaning of life, suffering, death and birth, unifies the trivial human beings, and grants value, safety and sense of belonging. In this age where even the annual flavor has faded away, there lingers the hope for the rebirth of ceremonies and celebrations belonging to our nation.
