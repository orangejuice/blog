The series of ritual ceremonies that take place one after another are truly awe-inspiring. Each human civilization has developed its own unique festivals and rituals tightly connected to their culture and tribe. Embedded within these events is a profound essence of connection to ancestors, guiding individuals to forge their own understanding of life, pain, and the significance of death and existence. It binds the frailty of humans together, endowing them with value, security, and belonging. In an era where even traditional flavors have faded, there's a longing for the phoenix-like rebirth of our national rituals and celebrations.
