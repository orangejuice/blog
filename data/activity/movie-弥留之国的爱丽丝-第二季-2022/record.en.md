I couldn't make it past the first episode. What on earth did they film? Overly shocking and exaggerated expressions, aside from the main characters everyone else just dies randomly. The invincible halo is exploded, the car flips and they climb out and walk away, Madonna complex always on. The male is too cool even when running away with hands in pockets, the female is pristine with a bikini top, smooth skin and soft hair. Apart from the final answer being the only temptation left, there is no suspense left, the screenwriters were too lazy to write plot details, and the production team indulged themselves. The setting is arbitrary, with blatant display of violent element, sexual element, and touching element to harvest income.
