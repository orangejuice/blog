Couldn't even continue after the first episode. What on earth did they make? Exaggerated expressions at every turn, only the protagonist survives as everyone else dies randomly. The invincibility aura is on full blast, people flip cars, crawl out and walk away, with a savior complex popping up frequently alongside vacant flashbacks. Guys stuff hands in pockets even when running away, girls are in pristine tank tops and bikinis, with smooth skin and silky hair. While the ultimate question remains intriguing, the mystery is gone, the screenwriters became lazy with the details. The crew let loose, carelessly arranging scenes, blatantly showcasing elements of violence, sex, and sentimentality to harvest revenue.
