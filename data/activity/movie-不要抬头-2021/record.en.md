Not exceptional, somewhat dramatic, market/consumer-oriented, and rather formulaic, which makes it dull and stiff. Giving it three stars feels too low. As for the plot, the musical numbers and the male lead's frenzied moments of reflection are notable. Overall, the story is complete, offering an ending that satisfies curiosity rather than leaving an awkward cliffhanger. On the point that humanity is doomed, we agree.
