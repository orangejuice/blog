It cannot be considered excellent, quite a bit of drama, market/consumer-orientated, somewhat formulaic, which appears boring and rigid. Giving it three stars seems a bit low. In terms of the plot, the captivating dance and music scenes and the main characterâ€™s self-reflection, plus the hysterical moments are not bad. Overall, the story is very complete, provides closure and satisfies curiosity, rather than leaving an awkward cliffhanger. In terms of humanity coming to an end, we have reached an agreement.
