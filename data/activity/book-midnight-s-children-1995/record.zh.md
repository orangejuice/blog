  title: Midnight's Children
  subtitle: Salman Rushdie / 1995 / Vintage
  intro: Saleem Sinai was born at midnight, the midnight of India's independence,
    and found himself mysteriously 'handcuffed to history' by the coincidence.
    He is one of 1,001 children born at the midnight hour, each of them endowed
    with an extraordinary talent - and whose privilege and curse it is to be
    both master and victims of their times. Through Saleem's gifts - inner ear
    and wildly sensitive sense of smell - we are drawn into a fascinating family
    saga set against the vast, colourful background of the India of the 20th
    century.
