Via tw mier, I came across Zhi'an's earlier post about 'if you could only read three books in your lifetime.' My choices would be these three: Cao Xueqin's 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' Fyodor Dostoevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov,' and Haruki Murakami's 'Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World'.
