The conflict created at the beginning is not so good, the story is self-indulgent, without any exciting pretext, quite like a supernatural drama. The story is really a good one, and the war scenes are not taken lightly either, turning a good story into a clich√© drama is a bit boring and shaky. There is nothing substantial beneath the flashy surface. The intricate details are lacking. Fast-forward to watch the exciting parts.
