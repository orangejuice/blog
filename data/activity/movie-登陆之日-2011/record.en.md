The conflict created at the beginning is not very good, the story is self-indulgent, thrilling without cause, quite melodramatic. The story itself is really good, and the battlefield scenes are elaborately done, turning a good story into clich√©d, boring drama with incessantly shaky cinematography. Beneath the surface gloss, it's rather hollow, lacking depth. I fast-forwarded through to watch only the exciting parts.
