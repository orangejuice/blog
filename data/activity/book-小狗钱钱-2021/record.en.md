Via Twitter user Lao Bai, reviews on Douban frequently express regret for not having read this book earlier. If you're someone whose money is idling in Yu'E Bao earning minimal interest, perpetually owing on Huabei, spending your entire monthly allowance without saving anything, then 'Money-Smart Kids' is like a financial rescue. The book is packed with practical advice. You'll overturn your flawed financial concepts as it helps you develop proper spending and investing attitudes. You'll understand how to make your money work for you, how to choose funds, and how to allocate assets, among other things. After reading this book, I gradually transitioned from a frivolous spender to a sensible consumer with my own savings, and later my investments in funds all showed profitable returns. I'm truly grateful for this book.
