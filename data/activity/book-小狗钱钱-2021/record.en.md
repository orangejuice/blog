According to a tweet by User Lao Bai, it's common to see comments like 'I regret not reading this book earlier!' in the book reviews of 'Money Dog' on Douban. If you are the kind who keeps your money in Yu'E Bao merely earning pennies in interest, always owing money to Huabei, spending all your monthly allowance without any savings, then this book is here to give you money. It's full of practical content that overthrows all your misconceptions about financing. It helps you establish a proper view of consumption and finance, teaching you how to make money work for you, how to choose funds, how to allocate assets, etc. After reading this book, I gradually transformed from a 'Huabei addict', who spends money recklessly, into a rational consumer with my own little treasure chest. I later invested in funds, and all my profits were positive. I'm truly thankful for this book.
