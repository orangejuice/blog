Via tw Dou Xiao Dou: Humanity lacks precise measures for its own needs, its own understanding, and its own suffering. Human language is like a broken pot, which we strike in the hope of creating resonant sound. We hope to touch the stars, yet only Dancing Bears respond to our noise. - Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary
