Via Twitter user @DouXiaoDou: Because humans always lack precise measures for their own needs, their own understanding, and their own suffering. Moreover, human language is like a broken pot, we bang on it hoping for a resonant sound. We wish to move the stars, yet it’s only the bears that hear the sound and begin to dance.
— Gustave Flaubard, Madame Bovary
