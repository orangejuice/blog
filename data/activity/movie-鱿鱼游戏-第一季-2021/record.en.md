The show targets the psychology of the audience, with adrenaline surging and a test of human nature as a group of people fight for their lives. The scope and imagined space are too small, and as the inside story is revealed bit by bit, it feels more and more out of control, with many parts lacking in logic. The Korean-style performance is strong, and the quirky and secondary characters are particularly nervous, with awkward dialogues. The game scenes are full of tension and fully powered, the glass bridge is a bit meaningless, the show for the VIPs is not much fun, flying all the way to South Korea just to watch a dual fight? A bit of a joke. The ending also lacks meaning. Start preaching the Virgin Mary, the reasons do not seem sufficient. The reason I came to watch this drama is that it sparked a hotspot, basically in line with expectations.
