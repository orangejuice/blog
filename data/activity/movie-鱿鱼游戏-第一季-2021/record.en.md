Targeting the psychology of the audience, adrenaline surges and the test of human nature, a group of people struggle for life and death in an instant. The scope and imagination are still too small; as the secrets are unveiled, it feels increasingly unmanageable, with many parts lacking logic. The Korean style of acting is intense, with peculiar and minor characters especially nerve-wracking, and the dialogue is awkward. The game sequences are very tense, going full throttle. The glass bridge scene was lacking, and the show for the VIPs wasn’t very interesting, flying all the way to Korea just to watch a dual combat? Somewhat humorous. The ending was also lacking, starting to preach, and the reasoning doesn’t feel sufficient. This series exploded into popularity, which is why I watched it, and it mostly met my expectations.
