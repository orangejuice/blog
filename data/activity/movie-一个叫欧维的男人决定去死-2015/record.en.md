Heartwarming. Beautiful storytelling, beautiful cinematography. Tears welling up, but not in pain. Two hours pass dreamily. Love is too precious, it's a gift. As a gift, it's not for everyone. Not everyone willing to spend the time getting close to you. Most people already long gone, no cats, no neighbors, no old friends, no love at first sight on the train, nothing at all.
