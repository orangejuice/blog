Heartwarming. A wonderful story with beautiful cinematography. Eyes moist, yet without pain. A bewildering two hours passed. Love is too precious, it’s a gift. And as a gift, not everyone possesses it. Not everyone is willing to spend the time to draw close to you, many more are already dead, without cats, neighbors, old friends, or a love-at-first-sight seatmate on the train. Nothing at all.
