In two months, I have sporadically read through these two large 'bricks', without skipping a chapter. The whole book does not contain any complex calculations or tedious jargon stack. The text is clear and smooth, enticing people to understand the underlying principles of economics through the economic phenomena they can personally experience. This allows a novice like me to comprehend the laws of the world's operations in a new way. The arrangement from micro to macro is naturally coherent, fully demonstrating the powerful force of the tool of supply and demand analysis. Of course, because the abstract models are overly simplified, they can only qualitatively analyze problems most of the time, which sometimes seems a bit far-fetched. Overall, the merits outweigh the demerits. Without a doubt, it is an excellent introductory work for economics.
