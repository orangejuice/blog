Via Twitter, Bugen Zhao mentioned spending two intermittent months to finish these two thick books, not skipping a single chapter. The book, free from complex formulas or dry terminologies, is written in a clear and fluent manner. It draws interest in economic principles through relatable economic phenomena, allowing someone like me, who is a novice, to understand the rules on which the world operates in a whole new way. The arrangement from micro to macro is naturally structured, fully demonstrating the powerful tool of supply-demand analysis. However, due to the overly simplified models, it often only provides qualitative analysis and can sometimes seem a bit forced. Overall, the merits outweigh the flaws, making it an undoubtedly excellent introduction to economics.
