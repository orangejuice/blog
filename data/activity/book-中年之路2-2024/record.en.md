Via tw @hutusi This book offers a popular interpretation of Jungian psychology, where Carl Jung believed: The purpose of life is not to pursue happiness, but to seek meaning. Here is an excerpt from the preface as a comment on the book:

The ideas, motives, and practices of Jungian psychology are that there are no sunlit meadows, no shady groves for restful repose; what truly exists is the swamp of the soul. Nature, along with our own nature, has intentionally arranged for a significant part of our journey to be spent here, where many meaningful moments of life are born. It is in such swamps that the soul is gradually forged; here, we encounter not only the solemnity of life but also its purpose, its dignity, and its deepest meaning.

What we need to do is: traverse the swamp to reach the broader horizons ahead.
