I downloaded it a long time ago but never got around to watching it. Having just learned about the history of the late Qing Dynasty, I immediately thought of this documentary and decided to watch it. The timing couldn't have been more perfect. I'm glad to have learned about this part of history. While feeling the unpredictability of life and the grand, merciless pace of the times, I also appreciate the quality of this documentary. These complex emotions are enough to make one clutch at their heart and feel a melancholic restlessness, pondering life, the nation, and society.
