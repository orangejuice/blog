I downloaded it a long time ago, but never got around to watching it. Having just read about history of the late Qing Dynasty, I immediately thought of this documentary and decided to watch it. The timing couldn't be more perfect. I'm glad to have learned about this part of history, while feeling the unpredictability of life, the grand and unfeeling progression of time, and admiring the quality of this documentary. These complex emotions are strong enough to make people beat their chests and stamp their feet, leaving them with a kind of inexpressible melancholy, leading them to perceive life, the nation, and society.
