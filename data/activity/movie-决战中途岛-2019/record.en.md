After watching 'Pearl Harbor,' I immediately saw this one. In terms of visuals, sound effects, and sets, it is apparent that it's either immature or crudely made, relying on high-end post-production effects and straying from the original intent of realistic portrayal. The acting level of Asian faces also clearly shows a stark contrast in quality. Nevertheless, these are minor issues; as for historical accuracy, it is still commendable, especially for those not very familiar with this subject matter.
