I watched this right after Pearl Harbor, and compared to it, this film is immature or even crude in terms of visuals, sound effects, and set design, relying on high-end post-production effects and deviating from the original intention of depicting reality. The difference in acting skills of the Asian actors is also glaring. Of course, these are secondary, from a historical perspective, it's still quite good, especially for those who know little about this topic.
