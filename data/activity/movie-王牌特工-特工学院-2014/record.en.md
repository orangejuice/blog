The setting is straightforward, with the plot advancing steadily. Alternates between life-and-death intensity and light-hearted silliness. Concentrated characterization, brutal and crisp combat scenes. Rich settings, cost ignored, creative special effects, a visualization of the affluentâ€™s downfall.
