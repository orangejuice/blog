Via tw StopCloud, upon reading 'Gu Zhun's Diaries', my heart leapt and my back felt as if it was doused with cold water. (I had the same feeling when reading 'The Gulag Archipelago'). Such characters are indeed illuminating for a millennium. In any era, Mr. Gu Zhun's disdain for the world is undoubted. What is such integrity, and it even surpasses his unparalleled talent.
