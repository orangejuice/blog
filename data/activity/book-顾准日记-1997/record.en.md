Via Twitter Tingyun, reading 'Gu Zhun's Diary', my heart skipped a beat, and my back felt as if cold water was poured over it. (I felt the same when reading 'The Gulag Archipelago'). Such a character truly shines through the ages. In any era, Mr. Gu Zhun's disdain for the world is unquestionable, as is the nobility of his character, which surpasses even his rare talents.
