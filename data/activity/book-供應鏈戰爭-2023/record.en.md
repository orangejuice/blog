Via Twitter: Successful People's New Book Recommendation: 'Supply Chain Wars'. This book discusses six raw materials: sand, salt, iron, copper, oil, and lithium. Humanity's pursuit of these materials has been filled with oppression and wars, profoundly shaping geopolitics. For instance, both American and Chinese politicians underestimated the complexity of the semiconductor supply chain and lacked sufficient understanding of how the raw materials world operates; even a small piece of glass lens influenced the situation in World War I. These materials are cheap, but their price does not equate to their importance.
