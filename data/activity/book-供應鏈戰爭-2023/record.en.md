Via tw Prominent People's New Book Recommendation: Supply Chain Warfare

This book discusses six raw materials: sand, salt, iron, copper, oil, and lithium. Human society's pursuit of these materials is filled with oppression and war, which significantly shape geopolitics. For instance, politicians from both the US and China underestimate the complexities of the chip supply chain and lack sufficient understanding of the operation of the raw material world. A small piece of glass lens also influences World War I situation. These materials may come cheap, but price should not be confused with importance.
