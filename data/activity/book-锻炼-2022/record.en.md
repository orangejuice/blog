Via Weibo user piglei: Not long ago, I read a book called 'Exercise'. A point of view in it left me quite impressed. The author poses a question: 'Can we run both fast and long-distance?' The author points out another fact. When we conclude that 'people cannot run both quickly and for long distances', we have ignored something important: we tend to focus only on the world's top performers and use their standards to evaluate 'speed' and 'distance'. Usain Bolt perhaps cannot run a full marathon, but a top-class marathon runner can finish 42 kilometers in approximately two hours. This speed translates to around 3 minutes per kilometer. Now ask yourself, 'Can I run 1 kilometer in 3 minutes?' You might be able to, but 99% of people can't run that fast. Therefore, it is possible that we can run 'both quickly and for a long period'. Similarly, we could be proficient in both arts and sciences, front-end and back-end. If we don't always compare ourselves to the world's top level, perhaps reaching the top 5% is enough.
