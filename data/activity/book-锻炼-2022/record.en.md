Recently, while going through a book titled 'Exercise,' I encountered a perspective that was quite shocking. The author, Daniel Lieberman, poses the question: 'Can we run both fast and far?' He noted another fact. When concluding that 'humans can't run both fast and far,' we tend to overlook something important: our focus is always on the few top performers in the world, using their standards to define 'fast' and 'far.' Usain Bolt may not be able to run a full marathon, but a top marathon runner can complete 42 kilometers in about two hours, which translates to approximately 3 minutes per kilometer. Now ask yourself: 'Can I run 1 kilometer in 3 minutes?' You might be able to, but 99% of people can't run that fast. Thus, maybe we can run 'both fast and far.' By extension, we might also master both humanities and science, both front-end and back-end development. If we stop focusing solely on the world's top standards, perhaps reaching the top 5% is already sufficient.
