It's very somber. The dilemma of life and death choices faced in front of power, the predicament of insufficient understanding of issues before the enlightenment of scientific rationality and humanism - all are startlingly portrayed. China's history has left countless more magnificent and profound chapters, but I hope that in this life, I can have the good fortune to immerse myself in works freely created from introspective history research. The subplot with ordinary characters is also well handled and has a distinctive Korean flavor.
