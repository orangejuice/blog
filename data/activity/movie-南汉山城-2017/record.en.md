Profoundly melancholic. It's heart-wrenching to see the dilemmas of life and death choices in the face of power, the intellectual entanglement before the enlightenment of scientific rationalism and humane awareness, and the deficient understanding of facts and principles. China's history has left behind many more grand and profound chapters. I hope in this life to have the fortune to be immersed in works created from historical reflections and free creation. The handling of minor characters is also well done, with a distinct Korean flavor.
