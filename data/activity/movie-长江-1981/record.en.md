Via tg Douban selection, I have always been very curious over the years as to how Mr. Masashi Sada negotiated with CCTV. How a national television station brazenly didn’t spend a dime, letting a young man from a different place borrow 3.5 billion yen to finish shooting the documentary 'Yangtze River'. Notably, after the young man finished shooting, the national television station used his material to cut up 25 episodes of 'Speaking of the Yangtze River', broadcasted it, but the main creator’s name wasn’t even mentioned. Whether they paid Mr. Sada any copyright fee, we don’t know. Mr. Masashi Sada, a talented and creative singer, held a small concert every two days to pay off his debts. After singing for 30 years, he finally paid off his debt.
