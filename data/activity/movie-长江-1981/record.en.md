Via Douban Select Over the years, I've been very curious about how Mr. Masashi Sada initially approached CCTV. How did a national TV station manage to shamelessly ask a young foreigner to borrow a whopping 3.5 billion yen to complete the documentary 'The Yangtze'? Most importantly, after its completion, this national broadcaster used the material to produce a 25-episode series 'Tales of the Yangtze,' which was broadcasted without even mentioning Mr. Sada's name. Whether he received any royalties is also unknown. Mr. Masashi Sada, a brilliantly talented singer-songwriter, had to hold a small concert every two days to pay off the debt, achieving it only after 30 years.
