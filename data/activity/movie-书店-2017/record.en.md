Via Twitter, Staci Yun's 'The Bookshop': Adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the same name. 'In a bookstore, one is never lonely.' The film is beautifully shot. The seaside town boasts stunning natural scenery, the female lead's styling is beautiful, and the scenes related to books are also beautifully captured. The movie narrates extensively through voice-over, voiced by a now-grown little girl. If one's life could be like a gift that brings beauty, hope, and courage to another, that would be enough.
