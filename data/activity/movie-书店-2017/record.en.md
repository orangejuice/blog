Via tw Stopyun 'The Bookshop' The film is adapted from Fitzgerald's novel of the same name. 'In a bookshop, you will never feel lonely.' The film is beautifully shot. The seaside town, the natural scenery, the styling of the lead actress, and scenes related to books are all beautiful. The film uses a lot of narration, told by the little girl when she grows up. If a person's life can be like giving a gift, bringing beauty, hope, and courage to another person, that's enough
