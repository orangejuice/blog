Senseless violence and killing with the protagonist's halo effect, a serious and tense dash around, pursuing spectacular visual effects through various grand ceremonies, and beautifully choreographed fight scenes. Character personalities, allegiances, and outcomes undergo sudden shifts, all indicating the air of an ordinary commercial movie. A particularly impressive aspect was the church's God's eye view shot, which was showy but visually appealing, adding a bright spot to the film.
