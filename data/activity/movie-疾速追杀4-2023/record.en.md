Non-stop action and protagonist's halo effect, serious and tense rush around, chasing the audience's visual effects of various ceremonies, glamorous fight scenes, sudden reversal of character's personality, position and results all reflect the vibe of just an ordinary commercial film. What was impressively good was the God's-eye view shot in the church, very flashy but also very good to look at, it is a bright spot.
