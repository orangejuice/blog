Via tw Left Hand Ink, we had lunch, which was a hometown dish called 'blurred noodles'. Despite our strong objections, my father insisted on adding spoonfuls of chili into the noodles. You must know, his stomach lining cannot bear such stimulation. Yet, father said: 'If I can't eat chili, what's the point of living? Might as well die early.' During my youth, we had a lack of vegetables and oil at home. We relied on chili to finish our meals. In winter, when the chili ran out, despite how much we tried to economize, the white radishes stored in sand also ran out. Then, my father would grind the chili stalks into powder, sprinkle it in the bowl, and he would still sweat profusely while eating it. Many houses in the village did the same. Sometimes, customs are linked with poverty.
