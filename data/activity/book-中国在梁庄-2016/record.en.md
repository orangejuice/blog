Via Twitter, Ink of the Left Hand. At lunch, I made hometown’s 'muddled noodles', and despite our strong objections, Dad insisted on adding spoonfuls of chili peppers. You should know that his stomach lining can’t handle this kind of irritation. Yet, Dad said, 'What’s the point of living if I can’t have chili peppers? Might as well die earlier.' In my youth, we barely had enough vegetables or oil, and relied solely on chili peppers for meals. During winter, when the chili peppers were gone, no matter how much we tried to save, the white radishes stored in the sand would also be finished. Then, Dad would grind the chili stems into powder, sprinkle it into our bowls, and we’d eat sweating profusely. Many families in the village did the same. Sometimes, customs are tied to poverty.
