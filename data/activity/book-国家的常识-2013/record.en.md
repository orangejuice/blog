Among the works read via tw white light, the recommended novels are Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird and Ted Chiang's short story collection, “Stories of Your Life”. George Orwell's 1984 is also recommended. The only divine plays in poetry I would recommend are Goethe's Faust, and The Ring of the Nibelung. As for social science works, I recommend Professor Roskin's introductory comparative politics work “Concept of the Nation” and Lazarsfeld's communication masterpiece, “People's Choice”.
