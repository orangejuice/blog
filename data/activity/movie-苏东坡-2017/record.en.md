Watching it, I didn't remember much. It's like a long-winded lecture, handing out time, place, personality, evaluation in a routine manner that makes one distracted. The pursuit of exquisite frames leaves a deep impression, every frame has been meticulously crafted. They've invited numerous experts to speak and went to various locations to capture a multitude of scenes – they've clearly spent a lot! The quest for visual effects is emphasized, but its core is disproportionate in comparison. With its plain and straightforward narrative, it lacks a human touch, deprives viewers from experiencing authenticity and the warmth of humanity, and feels more like distant pavilions. I wonder how many children find it fascinating and develop a liking for Su Shi – shouldn't this be something the producers consider? All these touching stories, yet none of them moves the tender parts of the heart when heard in the film. It feels like watching a supplementary DVD for a high school textbook. If you're hoping to get a vivid impression of Su Shi, this might not satisfy your appetite. Abandoning it feels wasteful – it can't be wasted like this. Fortunately, it’s not too long, so I'll jot down some notes when I revisit.
