After watching it, I didn't remember much. It felt like a lecture, stiff and monotonous, carefully listing time, place, characters, and reviews in order, causing the mind to wander. The film's pursuit of exquisite visuals, on the other hand, was impressive; every frame was crafted with effort, and countless experts and scholars were invited to speak. Extensive shooting locations across various places—truly a well-funded endeavor. While there's a focus on visual effects, it lacks a corresponding depth of content. The narrative is flat and devoid of a human touch, making the whole experience feel unreal, more like distant pavilions and towers than human warmth and reality. It’s puzzling whether this film would captivate children or endear them to Su Shi—a consideration that should have been in the translators' minds. Despite many touching stories, they came across as unaffected and sterile, reminiscent of watching a high school textbook's companion DVD. To get a vivid impression of Su Shi, unfortunately, this film might not satisfy. It's a shame to discard it—shouldn't waste it altogether, thankfully it's not too long. I might revisit it, jotting down key points.
