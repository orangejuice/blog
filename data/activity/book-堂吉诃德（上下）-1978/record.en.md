How does a great work become a masterpiece? It contains such a rich blend of emotion and reason that perhaps even the author himself is unaware. This new, purely textual creation, all born from the author's diligent efforts, casts the authorâ€™s shadow over the text. Humans are an interesting species, intriguing both on paper and in reality, and reality is most formidable, shaping humans and the adventures that lie beneath the pen. Yang Jiang's translation is also admirably impeccable. Reading is indeed a beautiful thing.
