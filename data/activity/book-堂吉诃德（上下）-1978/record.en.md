How do a masterpiece becomes a masterpiece, it contains an enormous amount of emotions and rationale, maybe the author himself does not even realize. This innovative, purely textual creation is all of the author's effort, then the author's shadow is cast upon the words. The human species is interesting, and so is the written words. The real world is the most powerful to create humans, and to create the adventures under human's pen. Yang Jiang's translation is also breathtaking. Reading is a wonderful thing.
