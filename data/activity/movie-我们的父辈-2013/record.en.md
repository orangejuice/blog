The entertainment elements are heavily overdone, with a vast battlefield where a few people can meet anywhere, and the arrangements of life and death are confusing. The movie intentionally leads the audience to believe it portrays real events, which is somewhat off-putting. Even if true, it appears to be a combination of extreme cases selectively pieced together from the entire battlefield into one picture. The film features a star dream female singer who lives in her own world and is tragically killed by her secret lover, a Jewish man who slashes through a train's undercarriage with a knife to escape and successfully infiltrates the Polish partisans, and another who avoids execution by escaping from the battlefield and killing his superior officer to survive, along with a brother who intentionally provokes enemy bombing with his anti-war stance, yet escapes punishment and transforms into a combat elite, fighting hundreds alone before ultimately committing a heroic suicide. Additionally, a Jewish spy transforms into a Soviet female officer, executing a Soviet nurse without blinking yet repeatedly emerges at critical moments to protect a German nurse who reported her, allowing her to survive until the end. Although the plot consumes and entertains with WWII themes with some unclear threads, the story is still above average, leaving me eager to see Chinese-language war films reaching this production level in my lifetime.
