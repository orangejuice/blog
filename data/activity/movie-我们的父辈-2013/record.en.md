The entertainment and dramatization aspects are quite heavy, where a few people can bump into each other in the vast battlefield. The arrangement of life and death scenes is perplexing. The movie intentionally leads the audience to believe it's a real event, which is slightly irritating. Even if it were real, it would presumably be a meticulously selected extreme case from the battlefield used to piece together a narrative. It involves a star dream female singer who, despite her beautiful face, exists in her own world and is brutally beaten to death by her own lover. A Jew who successfully joins the Polish guerrilla forces by cutting open the bottom of a train carriage with a knife on the go. A solider, who escapes from the battlefield, kills his officer, and survives against all odds. Then there's his brother who, opposed to war, deliberately attracts enemy bombings, doesn't get punished, and transforms into an elite fighter resisting hundreds of enemies before ultimately dying a heroic death. Also, thereâ€™s a Jewish spy who turns into a Soviet female officer, executes Soviet nurses without blinking an eye, and yet repeatedly steps up to protect the German nurse who reported her. Although it's a depiction of World War II that consumes the historic incident, with some threads unclear, the story is above average. After watching, it only makes me look forward to seeing Chinese war films of this production quality in my lifetime.
