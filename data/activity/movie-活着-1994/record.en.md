2019.11.12 The people on this land just want to live. / 2024.2.1 I don't know how many times I've watched it now. The vivid reds that fill the eyes, the dull blues tell the story of the film's differences. 'Uncle Ge' acts any role like it's tailor-made for him, yet retains his own style, admirable. This already beautified viewpoint still deeply lets one feel the impacts of last century's historical changes on peopleâ€”surviving isn't easy.
