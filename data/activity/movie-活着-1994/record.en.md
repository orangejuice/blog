2019.11.12 The people on this land, they just want to live. / 2024.2.1 Don't know how many times I've watched it. Vibrant red filling my vision, dull blue, telling different stories of the film. Whatever role Grandpa Ge plays, he nails it and brings his own style, I respect that. This beautified perspective still deeply conveys the impact the changing circumstances of the last century had on people, surviving wasn't an easy thing.
