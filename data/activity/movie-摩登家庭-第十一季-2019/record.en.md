On just an ordinary day, after many years of watching, the series came to an end. College gave me so many touching moments and a whole new understanding of family and love. Four years passed in the blink of an eye, never without the company of Modern Family. Such a beautiful series, I love this family so much. In the end, hugging each other, how I wish we could never let go!
