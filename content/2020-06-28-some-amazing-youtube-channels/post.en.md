title: Youtube Channels that I like

I was very ignorant about YouTube before - Although I often see it in the daily life, for example, some videos were being transported to Chinese websites and the transporters will tell the original Youtube video link, so occasionally I will visit the YouTube's website to see what is happening there. But the threshold for understanding English popular content on the Youtube homepage is too high and, thanks to its recommendation algorithm, an impression once went something like this: YouTube is full of poorly produced Falun Gong videos (e.g. machine-composed voice-over narration, nineties style videos).

Exposure to YouTube skyrocketed after arriving overseas, and almost all the world's videos are now hosted on YouTube . I forget where it started, but gradually discovered some YouTubers that produce very nice content (I must say, YouTube's recommendation feature is so powerful). Once you get used to the platform, it's getting easier to discover good quality channels. The first batch of channels that I followed (in 2018) were a couple of photography channels, and two knowledge-sharing veterans - Li Yongle / Kuai Zero, sort of lead me up to a new world.

Listed below are the channel owners that I have mainly followed so far, covering different areas including culture, politics, history, knowledge, etc. The channels listed directly under each category are basically channels that have very good content, are consistently high quality, and meet my current range of interests, so I must watch the new videos once it comes out. Channels categorized in other are not bad, but just because of limited time, or not the current point of interest, I will not keep paying attention to them.

Through this summary, I was also able to sort out the timeline and general scope of the channels I follow, and also found that not all the channels that I suscribed are very popular, but the channel owners are all living positivly and hard working on their content. This is probably the greatest benefit that the Internet can give us - allowing us to see the world with our eyes in many completely different perspectives. And despite seeing the same thing, different people will have completely different interpretations. 

## Language & Travel & Culture

### Kevin, Jared - China/East Asian/Canada

My favorite cultural channel, also the first cultural channel I follow: Kevin in Shanghai. There are currently 360k followers, there are various novel program themes, and the update frequency is relatively high. Kevin is a very interesting person, graduated from university in 2010, and uploaded the first video in 2015-Street Experiment: Find strangers on the street to borrow money. The number of videos started to increase since the beginning of the New Year 2017. Now I seem to be an English teacher while doing video and travel.

And he's also helped Jared over to become a Youtuber - who usually joking him coming from Hainan (he is actually a Canadian) , the two often collaborated to shoot videos so far. Jared's videos and experiences are also very interesting, and he has shot many videos of cultural comparison. He recently started to date a Chinese girlfriend. He currently has 320k followers.

Thomas is from Germany and now lives in Shanghai. He married a Chinese wife and wrote a German book describing the marriage life in China. Recently, the book has been translated and published a Chinese version. His video covers a wide range of various cultural differences/cuisine sharing/life challenges. In addition to introducing many aspects of China, there is also some German content in his YouTube channel. There are currently 410k followers. I knew Thomas through Kevin's video. Thomas and Jared did a random travel challenge together and went to Madagascar together at the end of 2019. It was very exciting.

By the way, Thomas' favorite video is the one that he tipped ￥20,000 to a taxi driver to take him back to the driver's home.

### 蒟蒻講幹話 - Taiwan/China

The number of his fans is currently 480k, and the content is as written by his channel name - easy to understand and covering a wide range, including astronomy, geography, history and religion. The topic will not make you bored, nor will you feel unnutritious, there is obviously a personal style in his videos. In short, it is a very interesting channel. Four typical masterpieces with the most broadcasts: 15 minutes to talk about World War II, 7 minutes to make you understand Islam, 10 minutes to understand Tzu Chi, and 15 minutes to talk about the Chinese Civil War .

### 和之梦 - Japan/China

There was a time when I enjoyed his series "The Reason Why I Live Here" day and night. I watched a lot of videos and felt like a new world opened in front of me. The interview subjects of this show are generally Japanese people living in China and Chinese people living in Japan. There are some very touching stories and experiences. The hosts' interviews flowed naturally, the production standards were high, and the key point he would often emphasize - a program without scripts. They currently have 210k followers. I think I learned about the show through a video which they interviewed the lighting engineer who made Li Zhi stage lighting effects. That episode was pretty nice.

His channel is updated very infrequently and he doesn't have many followers, only around 20k. There is a joke when his channel has new videos - Grandpa, your favorite channel is updated. The channel content is able to stand alone from the superficial mass narrative, stringing together historical facts from the past into a story of cause and effect. And he always explain things in a unique perspective, so his videos are somewhat interesting.

## History & Culture

### 袁腾飞 - Chinese/Global

Although I have seen other people talk about history, only Mr. Yuan's videos kept me interested all the time. Mr. Yuan is very passionate about education and history, and you can feel it graduately by watching more of his videos. From being a high school history teacher to now doing history popularization programs, he has always stuck to the same dream. People live in modern times are more or less restless and anxious, including myself, so really only interesting stories can keep people's attention. Reading a serious book is of course the proper way to learn history, but it's hard to keep a peaceful heart and the dedicated time for that. Although I have studied history for many years in the classroom, those rigid knowledge did not leave me any memories, let alone insights and own thoughts. Fortunately, Now I have Mr. Yuan to take me back to a living history class. 

Mr. Yuan is the first real history teacher I met in my life.

## Knowledge&Mind Opening

### Mr & Mrs Gao, 老肉雜談

My favourite chat show, they chat about things full of novelty, like a brainstorming. They are two separate groups, one is Gao (老高) and 小茉 (they live in Japan), one is Rou (老肉) and Teddy. They make great videos that are informative and fun, and with their different personal styles. Gao started the current channel in 2018, Rou was just recently started to do chat show as well. There's actually a little story between the two groups, hope they are still good friends. The style of their show is like ancient storytellers, not for telling serious scientific truth, but to keep people interested. Rou's relatively serious style is obviously not as flattering on the Internet as Gao's amusing one, but their videos are all pretty good! Their videos are always must-watch every time it comes out. 老肉 also used to do a series of eye-opening videos on small science experiments.

The combination of science frontiers and urban legends in their talk is easy to make people feel pretty curious. Their popularization and systematization of some interesting and marginal knowledge in the Chinese Internet community is a unique contribution. No doubt it will inspire audiences to think about science. Good luck to both Gao and Rou for keeping the show going, and maintaining their excellent standards. They now have 3 million and 90k followers respectively.

### 回形针PaperClip

The slogan of paperclip team: Your modern life manual. A great concept that I've thought about as well. You cann't imagine how much knowledge is involved in every aspect of modern life - how this wonderful world is even possible?! At present most people rely on their own fumbling and experience to give their own answers. Education is lagging behind in this regard, and modern education has not yet arrived - modern education is not a modernization of technology, but a modernization of educational theory. Don't you think there's already a barrier between it and modern society? Occasionally modern technology tries to invade education in some way, like the proliferation of various apps, there are some good attempts, but most of them are just crap. Paperclips and their philosophy can be a valuable exploration. Of course, making content and making high value content need too much of carefulness for not touching sensitive areas. The teams and individuals who are still committed to making valuable and desirable content are heroes.

### 越哥说电影

Possibly one of the first Chinese bloggers to start doing movie commentaries? There are currently 480k subscribers, and the commentaries are accurate and touching. A disappointment is the video cover and the exaggerated title. But it's hard to say, using a half-naked beauty as the cover is a realistic way to increase click rates. Using an exaggeratedly shocking title is a considerable amount of clicks and traffic. A lot of movies are long and the content is not easy to understand, given a cover and title for a movie and probably you won't subconsciously being curious on it. So it's not all bad, at least it attract a people to know about a movie that you might never seen it otherwise. At first I resisted watching this kind of film review program, but it was hism who gradually make me get used to it, and it gave me more chance to learn about some great movies that are not easy to discover. There is currently 490k followers.

### 李永乐老师

Li Yongle is also a phenomenal presence in the Chinese Internet. Li Yongle's videos are mainly about popularization of basic knowledge, scientific analysis of hot issues, doing live broadcast, sharing some of the programs he participated in, and debate competition. Through these live broadcasts and sharing, you can get to know the person of Li Yongle and his vision. A smart teacher with excellent presentation and debate skills are what he is. His videos also give a taste of the kind of person who puts words on the table and clearly expresses what his subtle thought is. So far there is a million followers now, it's been a difficult journey. Thanks for the internet making it possible for us to be students of Li Yongle.

The English video have a lot of professional words, so it is a little difficult to watch (in fact, watching the translated video does not help a lot as you still do not know what a word really means).
