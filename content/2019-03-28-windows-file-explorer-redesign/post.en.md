These prototype pictures are very beautiful and practical. It is truly shocking and coveted when I first saw them. So I immediately save these pictures, and now, share them here too.

Thanks for [@itsmichaelwest](https://twitter.com/itsmichaelwest) 's nice work!

So great design but can only watch, although no possibility to use it :(. Look at Microsoft, what are you doing?
